abstract = {Cells sense their physical surroundings through mechanotransduction - that is, by translating mechanical forces and deformations into biochemical signals such as changes in intracellular calcium concentration or by activating diverse signalling pathways. In turn, these signals can adjust cellular and extracellular structure. This mechanosensitive feedback modulates cellular functions as diverse as migration, proliferation, differentiation and apoptosis, and is crucial for organ development and homeostasis. Consequently, defects in mechanotransduction - often caused by mutations or misregulation of proteins that disturb cellular or extracellular mechanics - are implicated in the development of various diseases, ranging from muscular dystrophies and cardiomyopathies to cancer progression and metastasis.},

@article{Ma2004,
abstract = {Chemotaxing cells, such as Dictyostelium and mammalian neutrophils, sense shallow chemoattractant gradients and respond with highly polarized changes in cell morphology and motility. Uniform chemoattractant stimulation induces the transient translocations of several downstream signaling components, including phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K), tensin homology protein (PTEN), and phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-trisphosphate (PI(3,4,5)P3). In contrast, static spatial chemoattractant gradients elicit the persistent, amplified localization of these molecules. We have proposed a model in which the response to chemoattractant is regulated by a balance of a local excitation and a global inhibition, both of which are controlled by receptor occupancy. This model can account for both the transient and spatial responses to chemoattractants, but alone does not amplify the external gradient. In this article, we develop a model in which parallel local excitation, global inhibition mechanisms control the membrane binding of PI3K and PTEN. Together, the action of these enzymes induces an amplified PI(3,4,5)P3 response that agrees quantitatively with experimentally obtained plekstrin homology-green fluorescent protein distributions in latrunculin-treated cells. We compare the model's performance with that of several mutants in which one or both of the enzymes are disrupted. The model accounts for the observed response to multiple, simultaneous chemoattractant cues and can recreate the cellular response to combinations of temporal and spatial stimuli. Finally, we use the model to predict the response of a cell where only a fraction is stimulated by a saturating dose of chemoattractant.},

abstract = {Ligands that stabilize the formation of telomeric DNA G-quadruplexes have potential as cancer treatments, because the G-quadruplex structure cannot be extended by telomerase, an enzyme over-expressed in many cancer cells. Understanding the kinetic, thermodynamic and mechanical properties of small-molecule binding to these structures is therefore important, but classical ensemble assays are unable to measure these simultaneously. Here, we have used a laser tweezers method to investigate such interactions. With a force jump approach, we observe that pyridostatin promotes the folding of telomeric G-quadruplexes. The increased mechanical stability of pyridostatin-bound G-quadruplex permits the determination of a dissociation constant K(d) of 490 ± 80 nM. The free-energy change of binding obtained from a Hess-like process provides an identical K(d) for pyridostatin and a K(d) of 42 ± 3 µM for a weaker ligand RR110. We anticipate that this single-molecule platform can provide detailed insights into the mechanical, kinetic and thermodynamic properties of liganded bio-macromolecules, which have biological relevance.},

abstract = {The ionic and nucleotide requirements for the in vitro polymerization of microtubules from purified brain tubulin have been characterized by viscometry. Protein was purified by successive cycles of a temperature dependent assembly-diassembly scheme. Maximal polymerization occurred at a concentration of 0.1 M Pipes (piperazine-N,N'-bis(2-ethanesulfonic acid)); increasing ionic strength by addition of NaCl to samples prepared in lower buffer concentrations did not result in an equivalent level of polymerization. Both Na-+ and K-+ inhibited microtubule formation at levels greater than 240 mM, withmaximal assembly occurring at physiological concentrations of 150 mM. Maximal extent of assembly occurred at pH 6.8 and optimal rate at pH 6.6. Inhibition of polymerization was half-maximal at added calcium concentrations of 1.0 mM and magnesium concentrations of 10.0 mM. EGTA (ethylene glycol bis(beta-aminoethyl ether)tetraacetic acid), which chelates Ca-2+, had no effect on polymerization over a concentration range of 0.01-10.0 mM. In contrast, EDTA (ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid), which chelates both Mg-2+ and Ca-2+, inhibited assemble half-maximally at 0.25 mM and totally at 2.0 mM. As determined from experiments using Mg-2+-EDTA buffers, magnesium was required for polymerization. Magnesium promoted the maximal extent of assembly at substoichiometric levels relative to tubulin, but was maximal for both rate and extent at stoichiometric concentrations. Elemental analyses indicated that approximately 1 mol of magnesium was tightly bound/mol of tubulin dimer. Viscosity development was dependent upon hydrolyzable nucleoside triphosphate, and stoichiometric levels of GTP were sufficient for maximal polymerization. The effect of magnesium in increasing the rate of GTP-dependent polymerization suggests that a Mg-2+-GTP complex is the substrate required for a step in assembly.},

abstract = {Both protein and solid-state nanopores are under intense investigation for the analysis of nucleic acids. A crucial advantage of protein nanopores is that site-directed mutagenesis permits precise tuning of their properties. Here, by augmenting the internal positive charge within the alpha-hemolysin pore and varying its distribution, we increase the frequency of translocation of a 92-nt single-stranded DNA through the pore at +120 mV by approximately 10-fold over the wild-type protein and dramatically lower the voltage threshold at which translocation occurs, e.g., by 50 mV for 1 event.s(-1).muM(-1). Further, events in which DNA enters the pore, but is not immediately translocated, are almost eliminated. These experiments provide a basis for improved nucleic acid analysis with protein nanopores, which might be translated to solid-state nanopores by using chemical surface modification.},

abstract = {We have analyzed chemotaxis of neutrophil-differentiated HL60 cells in microfluidic devices that create exponential gradients of the chemoattractant, f-Met-Leu-Phe (fMLP). Such gradients expose each cell to a difference in fMLP concentration (DeltaC) across its diameter that is directly proportional to the ambient concentration (C) at that cell's position in the gradient, so the ratio DeltaC/C is constant everywhere. Cells exposed to ambient fMLP concentrations near the constant of dissociation (K(d)) for fMLP binding to its receptor ( approximately 10 nM) crawl much less frequently when DeltaC/C is 0.05 than when it is 0.09 or 0.13. Hence, cells can detect the gradient across their diameter without moving and, thus, without experiencing temporal changes in attractant concentration. At all DeltaC/C ratios tested, the average chemotactic prowess of individual cells (indicated by the distance a cell traveled in the correct direction divided by the length of its migration path) is maximal for cells that start migrating at concentrations near the K(d) and progressively decreases at higher or lower starting concentrations.},

abstract = {Capacitive deionization (CDI) is a novel technology that has been developed for removal of charged ionic species from salty water, such as salt ions. The basic concept of CDI, as well as electrosorption, is to force charged ions toward oppositely polarized electrodes through imposing a direct electric field to form a strong electrical double layer and hold the ions. Once the electric field disappears, the ions are instantly released back to the bulk solution. CDI is an alternative low-energy consumption desalination technology. Graphene-like nanoﬂakes (GNFs) with relatively high specific surface area have been prepared and used as electrodes for capacitive deionization. The GNFs were synthesized by a modified Hummers' method using hydrazine for reduction. They were characterized by atomic force microscopy, N2 adsorption at 77 K and electrochemical workstation. It was found that the ratio of nitric acid and sulfuric acid plays a vital role in determining the specific surface area of GNFs. Its electrosorption performance was much better than commercial activated carbon (AC), suggesting a great potential in capacitive deionisation application. Further, the electrosorptive performance of GNFs electrodes with different bias potentials, flow rates and ionic strengths were measured and the electrosorption isotherm and kinetics were investigated. The results showed that GNFs prepared by this process had the specific surface area of 222.01 m²/g. The specific electrosorptive capacity of the GNFs was 23.18 µmol/g for sodium ions (Na+) when the initial concentration was at 25 mg/L, which was higher than that of previously reported data using graphene and AC under the same experimental condition. In addition, the equilibrium electrosorption capacity was determined as 73.47 µmol/g at 2.0 V by fitting data through the Langmuir isotherm, and the rate constant was found to be 1.01 min⁻¹ by fitting data through pseudo first-order adsorption. The results suggested that the chemically synthesized GNFs can be used as effective electrode materials in CDI process for brackish water desalination.},

abstract = {The transport activity of purified Na+K+-ATPase was investigated by measuring the electrical pump current induced on black lipid membranes. Discs containing purified Na+K+-ATPase from pig kidney were attached to planar lipid bilayers in a sandwich-like structure. After the addition of only microM concentrations of an inactive photolabile ATP derivative [P3-1-(2-nitro)phenylethyladenosine 5'-triphosphate, caged ATP] ATP was released after illumination with u.v.-light, which led to a transient current in the system. The transient photoresponse indicates that the discs and the underlying membrane are capacitatively coupled. Stationary pump currents were obtained after the addition of the H+, Na+ exchanging agent monensin together with valinomycin to the membrane system, which increased the permeability of the black lipid membrane for the pumped ions. In the absence of ADP and Pi the half saturation for the maximal photoeffect was obtained at 6.5 microM released ATP. The addition of ADP decreased the pump activity. Pump activity was obtained only in the presence of Mg2+ together with Na+ and Na+ and K+. No pump current was obtained in the presence of Mg2+ together with K+. The electrical response was blocked completely by the Na+K+-ATPase-specific inhibitors vanadate and ouabain. No pump currents were observed with a chemically modified protein, which was labelled on the ATP binding site with fluoresceine isothiocyanate. The method described offers the possibility of investigating by direct electrical measurements ion transport of Na+K+-ATPase with a large variety of different parameters.},

We now report the partial purification of a protein from squid giant axons and optic lobes that induces these microtubule-based movements and show that there is a homologous protein in bovine brain. The purification of the translocator protein depends primarily on its unusual property of forming a high affinity complex with microtubules in the presence of a nonhydrolyzable ATP analog, adenylyl imidodiphosphate. The protein, once released from microtubules with ATP, migrates on gel filtration columns with an apparent molecular weight of 600 kilodaltons and contains 110-120 and 60-70 kilodalton polypeptides. This protein is distinct in molecular weight and enzymatic behavior from mysin or dynein, which suggests that it belongs to a novel class of force-generating molecules, for which we propose the name kinesin.},

Phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI 3-kinase), previously thought by some to be essential for chemotaxis, has now been proven to be dispensable. However, other pathways are emerging which might connect signalling to migration. In particular, phospholipase A2 homologues appear to play an important role. Other areas of current interest include the fundamental processes by which cells move - pseudopods have been found to be generated in many different ways. Similarly, chemotaxis may be mediated by multiple checks on the number of pseudopods, rather than by simple generation of new pseudopods on demand. Finally, we review several advances in the theory of how cells convert shallow, noisy chemical gradients into overt movement.},

abstract = {Myoglobin is a typical globular protein, and is found in many animal cells. Like h{\ae}moglobin, it combines reversibly with molecular oxygen; but whereas the role of h{\ae}moglobin is to transport oxygen in the blood stream, that of myoglobin is to store it temporarily within the cells (a function particularly important in diving animals such as whales, seals and penguins, the dark red tissues of which contain large amounts of myoglobin, and which have been our principal sources of the protein). Both molecules include a non-protein moiety, consisting of an iron-porphyrin complex known as the h{\ae}m group, and it is this group which actually combines with oxygen; h{\ae}moglobin, with a molecular weight of 67,000, contains four h{\ae}m groups, whereas myoglobin has only one. This, together with about 152 aminoacid residues, makes up a molecular weight of 17,000, so that myoglobin is one of the smaller proteins. Its small size was one of the main reasons for our choice of myoglobin as a subject for X-ray analysis.},

abstract = {We study the entry and transport of a polyelectrolyte, dextran sulfate (DS), through an asymmetric alpha-hemolysin protein channel inserted into a planar lipid bilayer. We compare the dynamics of the DS chains as they enter the channel at the opposite stem or vestibule sides. Experiments are performed at the single-molecule level by using an electrical method. The frequency of current blockades varies exponentially as a function of applied voltage. This frequency is smaller for the stem entrance than for the vestibule one, due to a smaller coupling with the electric field and a larger activation energy for entry. The value of the activation energy is quantitatively interpreted as an entropic effect of chain confinement. The translocation time decreases when the applied voltage increases and displays an exponential variation which is independent of the stem or vestibule sides.},

abstract = {Nanopores hold great promise as single-molecule analytical devices and biophysical model systems because the ionic current blockades they produce contain information about the identity, concentration, structure, and dynamics of target molecules. The porin MspA of Mycobacterium smegmatis has remarkable stability against environmental stresses and can be rationally modified based on its crystal structure. Further, MspA has a short and narrow channel constriction that is promising for DNA sequencing because it may enable improved characterization of short segments of a ssDNA molecule that is threaded through the pore. By eliminating the negative charge in the channel constriction, we designed and constructed an MspA mutant capable of electronically detecting and characterizing single molecules of ssDNA as they are electrophoretically driven through the pore. A second mutant with additional exchanges of negatively-charged residues for positively-charged residues in the vestibule region exhibited a factor of approximately 20 higher interaction rates, required only half as much voltage to observe interaction, and allowed ssDNA to reside in the vestibule approximately 100 times longer than the first mutant. Our results introduce MspA as a nanopore for nucleic acid analysis and highlight its potential as an engineerable platform for single-molecule detection and characterization applications.},

abstract = {Single-molecule imaging analysis of chemotactic response in eukaryotic cells has revealed a stochastic nature in the input signals and the signal transduction processes. This leads to a fundamental question about the signaling processes: how does the signaling system operate under stochastic fluctuations or noise? Here, we report a stochastic model of chemotactic signaling in which noise and signal propagation along the transmembrane signaling pathway by chemoattractant receptors can be analyzed quantitatively. The results obtained from this analysis reveal that the second-messenger-production reactions by the receptors generate noisy signals that contain intrinsic noise inherently generated at this reaction and extrinsic noise propagated from the ligand-receptor binding. Such intrinsic and extrinsic noise limits the directional sensing ability of chemotactic cells, which may explain the dependence of chemotactic accuracy on chemical gradients that has been observed experimentally. Our analysis also reveals regulatory mechanisms for signal improvement in the stochastically operating signaling system by analyzing how the SNR of chemotactic signals can be improved on or deteriorated by the stochastic properties of receptors and second-messenger molecules. Theoretical consideration of noisy signal transduction by chemotactic signaling systems can further be applied to signaling systems in general.},

abstract = {To explore the analytic relevance of unbinding force measurements between complementary DNA strands with an atomic force microscope, we measured the forces to mechanically separate a single DNA duplex under physiological conditions by pulling at the opposite 5'-ends as a function of the loading rate (dynamic force spectroscopy). We investigated DNA duplexes with 10, 20, and 30 base pairs with loading rates in the range of 16-4,000 pN/s. Depending on the loading rate and sequence length, the unbinding forces of single duplexes varied from 20 to 50 pN. These unbinding forces are found to scale with the logarithm of the loading rate, which is interpreted in terms of a single energy barrier along the mechanical separation path. The parameters describing the energy landscape, i.e. , the distance of the energy barrier to the minimum energy along the separation path and the logarithm of the thermal dissociation rate, are found to be proportional to the number of base pairs of the DNA duplex. These single molecule results allow a quantitative comparison with data from thermodynamic ensemble measurements and a discussion of the analytic applications of unbinding force measurements for DNA.},

abstract = {Large-area graphene growth is required for the development and production of electronic devices. Recently, chemical vapor deposition (CVD) of hydrocarbons has shown some promise in growing large-area graphene or few-layer graphene films on metal substrates such as Ni and Cu. It has been proposed that CVD growth of graphene on Ni occurs by a C segregation or precipitation process whereas graphene on Cu grows by a surface adsorption process. Here we used carbon isotope labeling in conjunction with Raman spectroscopic mapping to track carbon during the growth process. The data clearly show that at high temperatures sequentially introduced isotopic carbon diffuses into the Ni first, mixes, and then segregates and precipitates at the surface of Ni forming graphene and/or graphite with a uniform mixture of (12)C and (13)C as determined by the peak position of the Raman G-band peak. On the other hand, graphene growth on Cu is clearly by surface adsorption where the spatial distribution of (12)C and (13)C follows the precursor time sequence and the linear growth rate ranges from about 1 to as high as 6 mum/min depending upon Cu grain orientation. This data is critical in guiding the graphene growth process as we try to achieve the highest quality graphene for electronic devices.},

The nucleotide contents are identical, and in both cases the conformation of the GTP-containing, intra-dimer interface is indistinguishable from the GDP-containing, inter-dimer contact. Here we present two structures corresponding to the start and end points in the microtubule polymerization and hydrolysis cycles that illustrate the consequences of nucleotide state on longitudinal and lateral assembly. In the absence of depolymerizers, GDP-bound tubulin shows distinctive intra-dimer and inter-dimer interactions and thus distinguishes the GTP and GDP interfaces. A cold-stable tubulin polymer with the non-hydrolysable GTP analogue GMPCPP, containing semi-conserved lateral interactions, supports a model in which the straightening of longitudinal interfaces happens sequentially, starting with a conformational change after GTP binding that straightens the dimer enough for the formation of lateral contacts into a non-tubular intermediate. Closure into a microtubule does not require GTP hydrolysis.},

abstract = {Cells are divided into compartments and separated from the environment by lipid bilayer membranes. Essential molecules are transported back and forth across the membranes. We have investigated how folded proteins use narrow transmembrane pores to move between compartments. During this process, the proteins must unfold. To examine co-translocational unfolding of individual molecules, we tagged protein substrates with oligonucleotides to enable potential-driven unidirectional movement through a model protein nanopore, a process that differs fundamentally from extension during force spectroscopy measurements. Our findings support a four-step translocation mechanism for model thioredoxin substrates. First, the DNA tag is captured by the pore. Second, the oligonucleotide is pulled through the pore, causing local unfolding of the C terminus of the thioredoxin adjacent to the pore entrance. Third, the remainder of the protein unfolds spontaneously. Finally, the unfolded polypeptide diffuses through the pore into the recipient compartment. The unfolding pathway elucidated here differs from those revealed by denaturation experiments in solution, for which two-state mechanisms have been proposed.},

Solid-state nanopores currently suffer from the drawback, however, that the channel constituting the pore is long, approximately 100 times the distance between two bases in a DNA molecule (0.5 nm for single-stranded DNA). This paper provides proof of concept that it is possible to realize and use ultrathin nanopores fabricated in graphene monolayers for single-molecule DNA translocation. The pores are obtained by placing a graphene flake over a microsize hole in a silicon nitride membrane and drilling a nanosize hole in the graphene using an electron beam. As individual DNA molecules translocate through the pore, characteristic temporary conductance changes are observed in the ionic current through the nanopore, setting the stage for future single-molecule genomic screening devices.},

abstract = {The molecular motor gliding assay, in which a microtubule or other filament moves across a surface coated with motors, has provided much insight into howmolecular motorswork. The kinesin-microtubule system is also a strong candidate for the job of nanoparticle transporter in nanotechnology devices. In most cases, several motors transport each filament. Each motor serves both to bind the microtubule to a stationary surface and to propel the microtubule along the surface. By applying a uniform transverse force of 4–19 pN to a superparamagnetic bead attached to the trailing end of themicrotubule,we havemeasured the distance d between binding points (motors). The average value of d was determined as a function of motor surface density $\sigma$. The measurements agree well with the scaling model of Duke, Holy, and Liebler, which predicts that d∼ $\sigma$−2/5 if 0.05  $\sigma$  20 µm−2 [Phys.Rev.Lett. 74, 330 (1995)]. The distribution of d fits an extension of the model. The radius of curvature of a microtubule bent at a binding point by the force of the magnetic bead was ≈1 µm, 5000-fold smaller than the radius of curvature of microtubules subjected only to thermal forces. This is evidence that at these points of high bending stress, generated by the force on the magnetic bead, the microtubule is in the more flexible state of a two-state model of microtubule bending proposed by Heussinger, Sch¨ uller, and Frey [Phys. Rev. E 81, 021904 (2010)].},

It prevented accumulation of chondroitin sulfate proteoglycans and rendered the lesion site permissive for axon regeneration of growth-competent sensory neurons. Microtubule stabilization also promoted growth of central nervous system axons of the Raphe-spinal tract and led to functional improvement.

We measure the tensile response of single-stranded DNA as a function of sequence and monovalent salt concentration to examine the effects of base-stacking on the mechanical and thermodynamic properties of single-stranded DNA. By comparing the elastic response of highly stacked poly(dA) and that of a polypyrimidine sequence with minimal stacking, we find that base-stacking in poly(dA) significantly enhances the polymer's rigidity. The unstacking transition of poly(dA) at high force reveals that the intrinsic electrostatic tension on the molecule varies significantly more weakly on salt concentration than mean-field predictions. Further, we provide a model-independent estimate of the free energy difference between stacked poly(dA) and unstacked polypyrimidine, finding it to be ???-0.25 kBT/base and nearly constant over three orders of magnitude in salt concentration. ?? 2014 Biophysical Society.},

abstract = {We characterize the substate structure of current blockades produced when single-stranded polynucleotide molecules were electrophoretically driven into the alpha-hemolysin protein pore. We frequently observe substates where the ionic current is reduced by approximately 50{\%}. Most of these substates can be associated with a molecular configuration where a polymer occupies only the vestibule region of the pore, though a few appear related to a polymer occupying only the transmembrane beta-barrel region of the pore. The duration of the vestibule configuration depends on polymer composition and on which end of the polymer, 3' or 5', subsequently threads into the narrowest constriction and initiates translocation. Below approximately 140 mV a polymer is more likely to escape from the vestibule against the applied voltage gradient, while at higher voltages a polymer is more likely to follow the voltage gradient by threading through the narrowest constriction and translocating through the pore. Increasing the applied voltage also increases the duration of the vestibule configuration. A semiquantitative model of these trends suggests that escape has stronger voltage dependence than threading, and that threading is sensitive to polymer orientation while escape is not. These results emphasize the utility of alpha-hemolysin as a model system to study biologically relevant physical and chemical processes at the single-molecule level.},

This technique enables us to image the heat source distribution in light-absorbing systems such as plasmonic nanostructures. While the temperature distribution in plasmonic nanostructures is always fairly uniform because of the fast thermal diffusion in metals, we show that the heat source density is much more contrasted. Unexpectedly the heat origin (thermal hot spots) usually does not correspond to the optical hot spots of the plasmon mode. Numerical simulations based on the Green dyadic method confirm our observations and enable us to derive the general physical rules governing heat generation in plasmonic structures.},

At present, conventional implant materials fail owing to encapsulation by soft tissue, rather than direct bone bonding. Here, we demonstrate the use of nanoscale disorder to stimulate human mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) to produce bone mineral in vitro, in the absence of osteogenic supplements. This approach has similar efficiency to that of cells cultured with osteogenic media. In addition, the current studies show that topographically treated MSCs have a distinct differentiation profile compared with those treated with osteogenic media, which has implications for cell therapies.},

Here we demonstrate the ability to resolve changes in current that correspond to a known DNA sequence by combining the high sensitivity of a mutated form of the protein pore Mycobacterium smegmatis porin A (MspA) with phi29 DNA polymerase (DNAP), which controls the rate of DNA translocation through the pore. As phi29 DNAP synthesizes DNA and functions like a motor to pull a single-stranded template through MspA, we observe well-resolved and reproducible ionic current levels with median durations of ∼28 ms and ionic current differences of up to 40 pA. Using six different DNA sequences with readable regions 42-53 nucleotides long, we record current traces that map to the known DNA sequences. With single-nucleotide resolution and DNA translocation control, this system integrates solutions to two long-standing hurdles to nanopore sequencing.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: It is not yet known whether DNA methylation levels can be used to accurately predict age across a broad spectrum of human tissues and cell types, nor whether the resulting age prediction is a biologically meaningful measure.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: I developed a multi-tissue predictor of age that allows one to estimate the DNA methylation age of most tissues and cell types. The predictor, which is freely available, was developed using 8,000 samples from 82 Illumina DNA methylation array datasets, encompassing 51 healthy tissues and cell types. I found that DNA methylation age has the following properties: first, it is close to zero for embryonic and induced pluripotent stem cells; second, it correlates with cell passage number; third, it gives rise to a highly heritable measure of age acceleration; and, fourth, it is applicable to chimpanzee tissues. Analysis of 6,000 cancer samples from 32 datasets showed that all of the considered 20 cancer types exhibit significant age acceleration, with an average of 36 years. Low age-acceleration of cancer tissue is associated with a high number of somatic mutations and TP53 mutations, while mutations in steroid receptors greatly accelerate DNA methylation age in breast cancer. Finally, I characterize the 353 CpG sites that together form an aging clock in terms of chromatin states and tissue variance.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSIONS: I propose that DNA methylation age measures the cumulative effect of an epigenetic maintenance system. This novel epigenetic clock can be used to address a host of questions in developmental biology, cancer and aging research.},

abstract = {As a single DNA molecule is positively supercoiled under constant tension, its extension initially increases due to a negative twist-stretch coupling. The subsequent attainment of an extension maximum has previously been assumed to be indicative of the onset of a phase transition from B- to scP-DNA. Here we show that an extension maximum in fact does not coincide with the onset of a phase transition. This transition is evidenced by a direct observation of a torque plateau using an angular optical trap. Instead we find that the shape of the extension curve can be well explained with a theory that incorporates both DNA twist-stretch coupling and bending fluctuations. This theory also provides a more accurate method of determining the value of the twist-stretch coupling modulus, which has possibly been underestimated in previous studies that did not take into consideration the bending fluctuations. Our study demonstrates the importance of torque detection in the correct identification of phase transitions as well as the contribution of the twist-stretch coupling and bending fluctuations to DNA extension.},

abstract = {ISSN: 1040-9238 (Print) 1549-7798 (Online) Journal homepage: http://www.tandfonline.com/loi/ibmg20 Abstract Helicases are a diverse group of molecular motors that utilize energy derived from the hydrolysis of nucleoside triphosphates (NTPs) to unwind and translocate along nucleic acids. These enzymes play critical roles in nearly all aspects of nucleic acid metabolism, and consequently, a detailed understanding of helicase mechanisms at the molecular level is essential. Over the past few decades, single-molecule techniques, such as optical tweezers, magnetic tweezers, laminar flow, fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET), and DNA curtains, have proved to be powerful tools to investigate the functional properties of both DNA and RNA helicases. These approaches allow researchers to manipulate single helicase molecules, perturb their free energy landscape to probe the chemo-mechanical activities of these motors, and to detect the conformational changes of helicases during unwinding. Furthermore, these techniques also provide the capability to distinguish helicase heterogeneity and monitor helicase motion at nanometer spatial and millisecond temporal resolutions, ultimately providing new insights into the mechanisms that could not be resolved by ensemble assays. This review outlines the single-molecule techniques that have been utilized for measurements of helicase activities and discusses helicase mechanisms with a focus on functional and mechanistic insights revealed through single-molecule investigations in the past five years.},

abstract = {We introduce a computational method for classification of individual DNA molecules measured by an alpha-hemolysin channel detector. We show classification with better than 99{\%} accuracy for DNA hairpin molecules that differ only in their terminal Watson-Crick basepairs. Signal classification was done in silico to establish performance metrics (i.e., where train and test data were of known type, via single-species data files). It was then performed in solution to assay real mixtures of DNA hairpins. Hidden Markov Models (HMMs) were used with Expectation/Maximization for denoising and for associating a feature vector with the ionic current blockade of the DNA molecule. Support Vector Machines (SVMs) were used as discriminators, and were the focus of off-line training. A multiclass SVM architecture was designed to place less discriminatory load on weaker discriminators, and novel SVM kernels were used to boost discrimination strength. The tuning on HMMs and SVMs enabled biophysical analysis of the captured molecule states and state transitions; structure revealed in the biophysical analysis was used for better feature selection.},

Here we describe PoreSeq, an algorithm that identifies and corrects errors in nanopore sequencing data and improves the accuracy of de novo genome assembly with increasing coverage depth. The approach relies on modeling the possible sources of uncertainty that occur as DNA transits through the nanopore and finds the sequence that best explains multiple reads of the same region. PoreSeq increases nanopore sequencing read accuracy of M13 bacteriophage DNA from 85{\%} to 99{\%} at 100× coverage. We also use the algorithm to assemble Escherichia coli with 30× coverage and the l genome at a range of coverages from 3× to 50×.

abstract = {Coupling nucleic acid processing enzymes to nanoscale pores allows controlled movement of individual DNA or RNA strands that is reported as an ionic current/time series. Hundreds of individual enzyme complexes can be examined in single-file order at high bandwidth and spatial resolution. The bacteriophage phi29 DNA polymerase (phi29 DNAP) is an attractive candidate for this technology, due to its remarkable processivity and high affinity for DNA substrates. Here we show that phi29 DNAP-DNA complexes are stable when captured in an electric field across the $\alpha$-hemolysin nanopore. DNA substrates were activated for replication at the nanopore orifice by exploiting the 3'-5' exonuclease activity of wild-type phi29 DNAP to excise a 3'-H terminal residue, yielding a primer strand 3'-OH. In the presence of deoxynucleoside triphosphates, DNA synthesis was initiated, allowing real-time detection of numerous sequential nucleotide additions that was limited only by DNA template length. Translocation of phi29 DNAP along DNA substrates was observed in real time at {\AA}ngstrom-scale precision as the template strand was drawn through the nanopore lumen during replication.},

@article{Smith2011a,
abstract = {Recently there has been intense and growing interest in the non-thermal biological effects of nanosecond electric pulses, particularly apoptosis induction. These effects have been hypothesized to result from the widespread creation of small, lipidic pores in the plasma and organelle membranes of cells (supra-electroporation) and, more specifically, ionic and molecular transport through these pores. Here we show that transport occurs overwhelmingly after pulsing. First, we show that the electrical drift distance for typical charged solutes during nanosecond pulses (up to 100 ns), even those with very large magnitudes (up to 10 MV/m), ranges from only a fraction of the membrane thickness (5 nm) to several membrane thicknesses. This is much smaller than the diameter of a typical cell (∼16 $\mu$m), which implies that molecular drift transport during nanosecond pulses is necessarily minimal. This implication is not dependent on assumptions about pore density or the molecular flux through pores. Second, we show that molecular transport resulting from post-pulse diffusion through minimum-size pores is orders of magnitude larger than electrical drift-driven transport during nanosecond pulses. While field-assisted charge entry and the magnitude of flux favor transport during nanosecond pulses, these effects are too small to overcome the orders of magnitude more time available for post-pulse transport. Therefore, the basic conclusion that essentially all transmembrane molecular transport occurs post-pulse holds across the plausible range of relevant parameters. Our analysis shows that a primary direct consequence of nanosecond electric pulses is the creation (or maintenance) of large populations of small pores in cell membranes that govern post-pulse transmembrane transport of small ions and molecules.},

As approximately four nucleotides affect the ion current of each level, we measured the ion current corresponding to all 256 four-nucleotide combinations (quadromers). This quadromer map is highly predictive of ion current levels of previously unmeasured sequences derived from the bacteriophage phi X 174 genome. Furthermore, we show nanopore sequencing reads of phi X 174 up to 4,500 bases in length, which can be unambiguously aligned to the phi X 174 reference genome, and demonstrate proof-of-concept utility with respect to hybrid genome assembly and polymorphism detection.

The accuracy of this chemotactic response relies on the ability of cells to infer gradients from the heterogeneous distribution of receptors bound by diffusing chemical molecules. Ultimately, the precision of gradient sensing is limited by the fluctuations of signaling components, including the stochastic receptor occupancy and noisy intracellular processing. Viewing the system as a Markovian communication channel, we apply techniques from information theory to derive upper bounds on the amount of information that can be reliably transmitted through a chemotactic cell. Specifically, we derive an expression for the mutual information between the gradient direction and the spatial distribution of bound receptors. We also compute the mutual information between the gradient direction and the motility direction using three different models for cell motion. Our results can be used to quantify the information loss during the various stages of directional sensing in eukaryotic chemotaxis.},

The first crystallographic analysis of a non-$\gamma$-tubulin $\gamma$TuRC component ($\gamma$-tubulin complex protein 4 (GCP4)) has resulted in a new appreciation of the relationships among all $\gamma$TuRC proteins, leading to a refined model of their organization and function. The structures have also suggested an unexpected mechanism for regulating $\gamma$TuRC activity via conformational modulation of the complex component GCP3.

We have managed to integrate kinesin motor proteins in closed submicron channels and to realize active electrical control of the direction of individual kinesin-propelled microtubule filaments at Y junctions. Using this technique, we demonstrate molecular sorting of differently labeled microtubules. We attribute the steering of microtubules to electric field-induced bending of the leading tip. From measurements of the orientation-dependent electrophoretic motion of individual, freely suspended microtubules, we estimate the net applied force on the tip to be in the picoNewton range and we infer an effective charge of 12 e- per tubulin dimer under physiological conditions.},

@article{Chowdhury2005,
abstract = {Traffic-like collective movements are observed at almost all levels of biological systems. Molecular motor proteins like, for example, kinesin and dynein, which are the vehicles of almost all intra-cellular transport in eukaryotic cells, sometimes encounter traffic jam that manifests as a disease of the organism. Similarly, traffic jam of collagenase MMP-1, which moves on the collagen fibrils of the extracellular matrix of vertebrates, has also been observed in recent experiments. Novel efforts have been made to utilize some uni-cellular organisms as "micro-transporters". Traffic-like movements of social insects like ants and termites on trails are, perhaps, more familiar in our everyday life. Experimental, theoretical and computational investigations in the last few years have led to a deeper understanding of the generic or common physical principles involved in these phenomena. In this review we critically examine the current status of our understanding, expose the limitations of the existing methods, mention open challenging questions and speculate on the possible future directions of research in this interdisciplinary area where physics meets not only chemistry and biology but also (nano-)technology. {\textcopyright} 2005 Elsevier B.V.

Since Wegner proposed the treadmilling theory for actin in 1976, it has largely been assumed that the chemical state of the bound nucleotide determines the rates of subunit addition and removal. This chemical kinetics view is difficult to reconcile with observations revealing multiple structural states of the polymer that influence polymerization dynamics but that are not strictly coupled to the bound nucleotide state. We refer to these phenomena as "structural plasticity" and discuss emerging evidence that they play a central role in polymer dynamics and function.},

A number of promising strategies have been explored in recent years, largely driven by the demands of next-generation sequencing. Engineering DNA-nanopore interactions (known to dominate translocation dynamics) with organic coatings is an attractive method as it does not require sample modification, processive enzymes, or complicated and expensive fabrication steps. In this work, we show for the first time 4-fold tuning of unfolded, single-file translocation time through small, amine-functionalized solid-state nanopores by varying the solution pH in situ. Additionally, we develop a simple analytical model based on electrostatic interactions to explain this effect which will be a useful tool in designing future devices and experiments.},

@article{Fuller2010,
abstract = {Chemotaxis, the chemically guided movement of cells, plays an important role in several biological processes including cancer, wound healing, and embryogenesis. Chemotacting cells are able to sense shallow chemical gradients where the concentration of chemoattractant differs by only a few percent from one side of the cell to the other, over a wide range of local concentrations. Exactly what limits the chemotactic ability of these cells is presently unclear. Here we determine the chemotactic response of Dictyostelium cells to exponential gradients of varying steepness and local concentration of the chemoattractant cAMP. We find that the cells are sensitive to the steepness of the gradient as well as to the local concentration. Using information theory techniques, we derive a formula for the mutual information between the input gradient and the spatial distribution of bound receptors and also compute the mutual information between the input gradient and the motility direction in the experiments. A comparison between these quantities reveals that for shallow gradients, in which the concentration difference between the back and the front of a 10-mum-diameter cell is {\textless}5{\%}, and for small local concentrations ({\textless}10 nM) the intracellular information loss is insignificant. Thus, external fluctuations due to the finite number of receptors dominate and limit the chemotactic response. For steeper gradients and higher local concentrations, the intracellular information processing is suboptimal and results in a smaller mutual information between the input gradient and the motility direction than would have been predicted from the ligand-receptor binding process.},

Crosslinking agents that target amine residues form intertubulin crosslinks that produce crosslinked microtubules (CLMTs) with structural and functional lifetimes that can be up to four times as long as those achieved with taxol stabilization. Such CLMTs are stable at temperatures down to -10 degrees C, are resistant to depolymerization induced by metal ions such as Ca2+, and yet continue to be adsorbed and transported by self-assembled monolayers containing the motor protein kinesin. However, crosslinkers that target cysteine residues depolymerize the MTs, probably by interfering with the guanosine triphosphate binding site. The impact of crosslink attributes, including terminal group chemistry, chain length, crosslink density, and specific location on the tubulin surface, on microtubule stability and functionality are discussed.},

Using different salts of monovalent and divalent cations in a wide range of concentrations and applied potentials, we analyze current fluctuations focusing on the voltage dependence of the additional white noise that appears in the low-frequency range of the spectra.We demonstrate that the channel displays two characteristic transport regimes: at low salt concentrations (10 mM to 1 M) ion permeation is controlled by the protein fixed charges that induce accumulation or exclusion of ions to preserve local electroneutrality. At high salt concentrations ({\textgreater}1M) adsorption processes associated to the binding of cations to the channel charges regulate the transport properties.},

We show that the model describes strand separation by elevated temperature, applied torque, and applied force. In particular, we show how the interactions responsible for stabilizing the double helix against thermal denaturation determine the approximately 12 pN force threshold for DNA strand separation. The larger rigidity of the strands when formed into double-stranded DNA, relative to that of isolated strands, gives rise to a potential barrier to unzipping. We show that this barrier results in a approximately 250 pN force barrier opposing the beginning of strand separation. The thermal-fluctuation-assisted "tunnelling" through the barrier is then analyzed using instanton calculations. The resulting kinetics of unzipping initiation is shown to be consistent with solution-phase strand dissociation experiments, and can explain results of two recent unzipping experiments done using atomic-force microscopy.},

abstract = {Purified tubulin fully liganded to GDP at the exchangeable nucleotide binding site has been prepared by a new direct nucleotide exchange procedure. This normally inactive GDP-tubulin is driven to assemble into microtubules by the binding of the antitumor drug taxol or its more soluble side-chain analogue Taxotere in Mg(2+)-containing buffer, and it disassembles by cooling the solution. Therefore this ligand-induced equilibrium microtubule assembly system dispenses with the requirement of a gamma-phosphate-metal cation ligand bound at the nucleotide site for tubulin to be active. GDP-tubulin can also form characteristic pseudo-ordered aggregates of double rings. These aggregates dissociate upon warming or by addition of GTP. Back-substitution of the nucleotide gamma-phosphate permits glycerol-induced assembly without taxol and reduces the critical protein concentration required for drug-induced microtubule assembly by a factor of 2.6 +/- 0.1. The ligand-induced assembly is maximal at taxol or Taxotere concentrations equimolar with tubulin, and both drugs bind to assembled tubulin with a stoichiometry of 0.99 +/- 0.04 ligand per alpha beta dimer. Taxotere apparently competes with taxol for the same binding site, with 1.9 +/- 0.1 times larger effective affinity. Similarly, the Taxotere-induced assembly of GDP-tubulin or GTP-tubulin proceeds with a critical protein concentration 2.1 +/- 0.1 times smaller than with taxol.},

abstract = {The electrophoretic mobilities of DNA molecules in three different molecular weight ladders were measured in polyacrylamide gels containing different acrylamide concentrations ({\%}T) and cross-linker ratios ({\%}C), cast and run in Trisacetate-EDTA (TAE) buffer. The apparent pore radius of each gel was estimated from Ferguson plots of the relative mobilities of each of the DNA molecules, using the mobility of the monomer fragment in each molecular weight ladder as the reference mobility. The effective size of each of the DNA molecules was estimated from its radius of gyration. The apparent gel pore radii calculated in this manner ranged from 21 nm in gels containing 10.5{\%}T, 5{\%}C to 200 nm in gels with 4.6{\%}T, 2{\%}C, similar to the values observed for polyacrylamide gels cast and run in Tris-borate-EDTA (TBE) buffer (Holmes and Stellwagen, Electrophoresis 1991, 12, 612-619). Hence, the effective pore size of polyacrylamide gels is essentially independent of whether the gels are cast and run in TAE or TBE buffer.},

abstract = {Superfamily 1B (SF1B) helicases translocate in a 5'-3' direction and are required for a range of cellular activities across all domains of life. However, structural analyses to date have focused on how SF1A helicases achieve 3'-5' movement along nucleic acids. We present crystal structures of the complex between the SF1B helicase RecD2 from Deinococcus radiodurans and ssDNA in the presence and absence of an ATP analog. These snapshots of the reaction pathway reveal a nucleotide binding-induced conformational change of the two motor domains that is broadly reminiscent of changes observed in other SF1 and SF2 helicases. Together with biochemical data, the structures point to a step size for translocation of one base per ATP hydrolyzed. Moreover, the structures also reveal a mechanism for nucleic acid translocation in the 5'-3' direction by SF1B helicases that is surprisingly different from that of 3'-5' translocation by SF1A enzymes, and explains the molecular basis of directionality.},

abstract = {Statistical fluctuations limit the precision with which a microorganism can, in a given time T, determine the concentration of a chemoattractant in the surrounding medium. The best a cell can do is to monitor continually the state of occupation of receptors distributed over its surface. For nearly optimum performance only a small fraction of the surface need be specifically adsorbing. The probability that a molecule that has collided with the cell will find a receptor is Ns/(Ns + pi a), if N receptors, each with a binding site of radius s, are evenly distributed over a cell of radius a. There is ample room for many indenpendent systems of specific receptors. The adsorption rate for molecules of moderate size cannot be significantly enhanced by motion of the cell or by stirring of the medium by the cell. The least fractional error attainable in the determination of a concentration c is approximately (TcaD) - 1/2, where D is diffusion constant of the attractant. The number of specific receptors needed to attain such precision is about a/s. Data on bacteriophage absorption, bacterial chemotaxis, and chemotaxis in a cellular slime mold are evaluated. The chemotactic sensitivity of Escherichia coli approaches that of the cell of optimum design.},

Specifically, in their Orchestrated Objective Reduction Orch OR model R. Penrose and S. R. Hameroff, J. Conscious. Stud. 2,99 1995, it is postulated that microtubules act as quantum processing units, with individual tubulin dimers forming the computational elements. This model requires that the tubulin is able to switch between alternative conformational states in a coherent manner, and that this process be rapid on the physiological time scale. Here, the biological feasibility of the Orch OR proposal is examined in light of recent experimental studies on microtubule assembly and dynamics. It is shown that the tubulins do not possess essential properties required for the Orch OR proposal, as originally proposed, to hold. Further, we consider also recent progress in the understanding of the long-lived coherent motions in biological systems, a feature critical to Orch OR, and show that no reformation of the proposal based on known physical paradigms could lead to quantum computing within microtubules. Hence, the Orch OR model is not a feasible explanation of the origin of consciousness.},

Homooligomers of same chain lengths exhibit remarkable differences in mobility. Specific retardation of any other oligonucleotide investigated was found to be mainly dependent on base composition but not on sequence. A simple procedure is presented for calculating mobilities relative to the standards on denaturing gels. This allows a reliable identification of oligonucleotides on acrylamide-gels by exact chain length determination with respect to base composition and furthermore a detailed interpretation of complex reaction mixtures. The homooligomers also show the same differences in mobility on nondenaturing gels. The significance of this effect for strand separation is discussed.},

The Pif1 signature motif of BaPif1 interacts with the wedge region and a short helix in order to stabilize these ssDNA binding elements, therefore indirectly exerting its functional role. Domain 2B of BaPif1 undergoes a large conformational change upon concomitant binding of ATP and ssDNA, which is critical for Pif1's activities. BaPif1 cocrystallized with a tailed dsDNA and ADP-AlF4-, resulting in a bound ssDNA bent nearly 90?? at the ssDNA/dsDNA junction.

abstract = {Several thermal TRP ion channels have recently been identified. These channels are directly gated by temperature, but the mechanisms have remained elusive. Studies of their temperature gating have been impeded by lack of methods for rapid alteration of temperature in live cells. As a result, only measurements of steady-state properties have been possible. To solve the problem, we have developed an optical approach that uses recently available infrared diode lasers as heat sources. By restricting laser irradiation around a single cell, our approach can produce constant temperature jumps over 50??C in submilliseconds. Experiments with several heat-gated ion channels (TRPV1-3) show its applicability for rapid temperature perturbation in both single cells and membrane patches. Compared with other laser heating approaches such as those by Raman-shifting of the Nd:YAG fundamentals, our approach has the advantage of being cost effective and applicable to live cells while providing an adequate resolution for time-resolved detection of channel activation. ?? 2009 by the Biophysical Society.},

These components are known to participate in the formation of many cellular structures, such as the dynamic asters found in mitotic and meiotic spindles. Purified motors and microtubules have previously been observed to form asters in vitro. We have reproduced this result with a simple system consisting solely of multi-headed constructs of the motor protein kinesin and stabilized microtubules. We show that dynamic asters can also be obtained from a homogeneous solution of tubulin and motors. By varying the relative concentrations of the components, we obtain a variety of self-organized structures. Further, by studying this process in a constrained geometry of micro-fabricated glass chambers, we demonstrate that the same final structure can be reached through different assembly 'pathways.},

A molecular construction is prepared for mechanically unzipping several thousand-basepair DNA sequences in an in vitro configuration. The force signals corresponding to opening and closing the double helix at low velocity are studied experimentally and are compared to calculations assuming thermal equilibrium. We address the effect of the stiffness on the basepair sensitivity and consider fluctuations in the force signal. With respect to earlier work performed with soft microneedles, we obtain a very significant increase in basepair sensitivity: presently, sequence features appearing at a scale of 10 basepairs are observed. When measured with the optical trap the unzipping force exhibits characteristic flips between different values at specific positions that are determined by the base sequence. This behavior is attributed to bistabilities in the position of the opening fork; the force flips directly reflect transitions between different states involved in the time-averaging of the molecular system.},

abstract = {The flexible loops decorating the entrance of OmpG nanopore move dynamically during ionic current recording. The gating caused by these flexible loops changes when a target protein is bound. The gating is characterized by parameters including frequency, duration, and open-pore current, and these features combine to reveal the identity of a specific analyte protein. Here, we show that OmpG nanopore equipped with a biotin ligand can distinguish glycosylated and deglycosylated isoforms of avidin by their differences in surface charge. Our studies demonstrate that the direct interaction between the nanopore and analyte surface, induced by the electrostatic attraction between the two molecules, is essential for protein isoform detection. Our technique is remarkably sensitive to the analyte surface, which may provide a useful tool for glycoprotein profiling.},

abstract = {Mitosis-specific agents have, to date, not been clinically successful. By contrast, microtubule-targeting agents (MTAs) have a long record of success, usually attributed to the induction of mitotic arrest. Indeed, it was this success that led to the search for mitosis-specific inhibitors. We believe the clinical disappointment of mitosis-specific inhibitors stands as evidence that MTAs have been successful not only by interfering with mitosis but, more importantly, by disrupting essential interphase cellular mechanisms. In this Perspective we will review literature that supports a paradigm shift in how we think about one of our most widely used classes of chemotherapeutics-MTAs. We believe that the steady presence and constant physiological role of microtubules are responsible for the overall success of MTAs. While mitosis-specific inhibitors are effective on only a small fraction of the tumor mass (dividing cells), MTAs target tubulin, a protein that has crucial roles in both mitotic and non-mitotic cells.},

@article{Morris1999,
abstract = {Helicases are enzymes that use energy derived from nucleoside triphosphate hydrolysis to unwind double-stranded (ds) DNA, a process vital to virtually every phase of DNA metabolism. The helicases used in this study, gp41 and Dda, are from the bacteriophage T4, an excellent system for studying enzymes that process DNA. gp41 is the replicative helicase and has been shown to form a hexamer in the presence of ATP. In this study, protein cross-linking was performed in the presence of either linear or circular single-stranded (ss) DNA substrates to determine the topology of gp41 binding to ssDNA. Results indicate that the hexamer binds ssDNA by encircling it, in a manner similar to that of other hexameric helicases. A new assay was developed for studying enzymatic activity of gp41 and Dda on single-stranded DNA. The rate of dissociation of streptavidin from various biotinylated oligonucleotides was determined in the presence of helicase by an electrophoretic mobility shift assay. gp41 and Dda were found to significantly enhance the dissociation rate of streptavidin from biotin-labeled oligonucleotides in an ATP-dependent reaction. Helicase-catalyzed dissociation of streptavidin from the 3'-end of a biotin-labeled 62-mer oligonucleotide occurred with a first-order rate of 0.17 min-1, which is over 500-fold faster than the spontaneous dissociation rate of biotin from streptavidin. Dda activity leads to even faster displacement of streptavidin from the 3' end of the 62-mer, with a first-order rate of 7.9 s-1. This is more than a million-fold greater than the spontaneous dissociation rate. There was no enhancement of streptavidin dissociation from the 5'-biotin-labeled oligonucleotide by either helicase. The fact that each helicase was capable of dislodging streptavidin from the 3'-biotin label suggests that these enzymes are capable of imparting a force on a molecule blocking their path. The difference in displacement between the 5' and 3' ends of the oligonucleotide is also consistent with the possibility of a 5'-to-3' directional bias in translocation on ssDNA for each helicase.},

abstract = {Until now a stable long-lived electronanopore could be generated in a lipid membrane only under current-clamp conditions, and stochastic properties of a single nanopore have been studied by the chronopotentiometry. The current-clamp experiment introduces negative feedback, which could be responsible for the electropore fluctuations and observed 1/fB power spectrum. A new electroporation method, chronoamperometry after current clamp (CACC), prevents irreversible rupture of the membrane and eliminates the feedback by clamping the voltage after previous electroporation. The experiments show that the electropore size can also be stabilized under constant potential. The electropore fluctuations do not need feedback to appear. The fluctuations are self-similar with a short memory. CACC provides an effective tool for studying the natural dynamics of an electropore in various environments, which was tested with Na+ and Al3+ ions. Comparison between chronopotentiometry and CACC reveals that the feedback mainly shortens the memory of the stochastic fluctuations. Statistical analysis shows that the conductance fluctuations can be approximately modeled as a fractional L{\'{e}}vy stable motion for a small hydrophilic electropore, which tends to fractional Brownian motion when the electropore increases its size. A hypothesis is presented that this transition reflects a more regular shape of big nanopores.},

@article{Meyer2007,
abstract = {The recent discovery of graphene has sparked much interest, thus far focused on the peculiar electronic structure of this material, in which charge carriers mimic massless relativistic particles. However, the physical structure of graphene--a single layer of carbon atoms densely packed in a honeycomb crystal lattice--is also puzzling. On the one hand, graphene appears to be a strictly two-dimensional material, exhibiting such a high crystal quality that electrons can travel submicrometre distances without scattering. On the other hand, perfect two-dimensional crystals cannot exist in the free state, according to both theory and experiment. This incompatibility can be avoided by arguing that all the graphene structures studied so far were an integral part of larger three-dimensional structures, either supported by a bulk substrate or embedded in a three-dimensional matrix. Here we report on individual graphene sheets freely suspended on a microfabricated scaffold in vacuum or air. These membranes are only one atom thick, yet they still display long-range crystalline order. However, our studies by transmission electron microscopy also reveal that these suspended graphene sheets are not perfectly flat: they exhibit intrinsic microscopic roughening such that the surface normal varies by several degrees and out-of-plane deformations reach 1 nm. The atomically thin single-crystal membranes offer ample scope for fundamental research and new technologies, whereas the observed corrugations in the third dimension may provide subtle reasons for the stability of two-dimensional crystals.},

As the channel was too narrow to accommodate hybridized DNA, dehybridization of the hairpin became the rate-limiting step of the transport process. We show that the mean first passage time versus voltage curve for the escape of the DNA from the transmembrane channel can be divided into two regions: (1) a low-voltage region where the DNA slides out of the pore in reverse and without undergoing significant dehybridization, and (2) a region where the DNA dehybridizes under the influence of the applied voltage and translocates across the membrane.},

abstract = {Unmodified neurons can be directly stimulated with light to produce action potentials, but such techniques have lacked localization of the delivered light energy. Here we show that gold nanoparticles can be conjugated to high-avidity ligands for a variety of cellular targets. Once bound to a neuron, these particles transduce millisecond pulses of light into heat, which changes membrane capacitance, depolarizing the cell and eliciting action potentials. Compared to non-functionalized nanoparticles, ligand-conjugated nanoparticles highly resist convective washout and enable photothermal stimulation with lower delivered energy and resulting temperature increase. Ligands targeting three different membrane proteins were tested; all showed similar activity and washout resistance. This suggests that many types of ligands can be bound to nanoparticles, preserving ligand and nanoparticle function, and that many different cell phenotypes can be targeted by appropriate choice of ligand. The findings have applications as an alternative to optogenetics and potentially for therapies involving neuronal photostimulation.},

abstract = {The folding of a dye-quencher labeled DNA hairpin molecule was investigated using fluorescence autocorrelation and cross-correlation spectroscopy (FCS) and photon counting histogram analysis (PCH). The autocorrelation and cross-correlation measurements revealed the flow and diffusion times of the DNA molecules through two spatially offset detection volumes, the relaxation time of the folding reaction, and the total concentration of DNA molecules participating in the reaction. The PCH measurements revealed the equilibrium distribution of DNA molecules in folded and unfolded conformations and the specific brightnesses of the fluorophore in each conformational state. These measurements were carried out over a range of NaCl concentrations, from those that favored the open form of the DNA hairpin to those that favored the closed form. DNA melting curves obtained from each sample were also analyzed for comparison. It was found that the reactant concentrations were depleted as the reaction progressed and that the equilibrium distributions measured by FCS and PCH deviated from those obtained from the melting curve analyses. These observations suggest a three-state mechanism for the DNA hairpin folding reaction that involves a stable intermediate form of the DNA hairpin. The reaction being probed by FCS and PCH is suggested to be a rapid equilibrium between open and intermediate conformations. Formation of the fully closed DNA hairpin is suggested to occur on a much longer time scale than the FCS and PCH measurement time. The closed form of the hairpin thus serves as a sink into which the reactants are depleted as the reaction progresses.},

Various nanofluidic devices were proposed to manipulate aqueous solutions and biomolecules at the nanoscale. The successful development of such systems has major implications for technologies focusing on water purification and processing of complex biological solutions. When the size is less than 5 nm, steric interactions and hydration affect ion and fluid flow, which is analyzed by stochastic and/or molecular dynamics.},

abstract = {Solid-state nanopores are routinely used as single-molecule detectors and show considerable promise as the framework for rapid DNA sequencing technology, but their performance is limited by conductance fluctuations. In this work, experimental studies with solid-state nanopores identify two major sources of conductance fluctuations: excess white noise in the 0.1–10 kHz frequency band used for single-molecule detection, and 1/f noise. Excess white noise is found to have two basic mechanisms. Fluctuations in the number of mobile ions in the pore arise from the diffusive motion of ions. These ionic number fluctuations are a fundamental limit to the equilibrium conductance noise. Protonation reactions of the silanol groups on the nanopore surface give rise to surface charge fluctuations, which can be measured to determine the protonation reaction rates. Two distinct mechanisms of 1/f noise are also present. The first type of 1/f noise, associated with “noisy” pores, may be the result of uncharged contaminants in the nanopore. The experiments in this thesis cannot distinguish among nanobubbles, phonon scattering, and charge traps as possible sources of the second type of 1/f noise. Finally, the implications of the various conductance noise sources for single-molecule detection are discussed. Detection of DNA molecules by ionic current measurements is straightforward, but angstrom-scale variations in a single molecule are indistinguishable from the conductance noise for all feasible pore geometries.},

abstract = {This paper describes a new technique employing fluorescent quantum dots as temperature probes for measuring the temperature rise in the proximity of nanoparticles heated by a radio frequency (rf) electromagnetic field. The remote heating of nanoparticles by an rf field is a promising approach to control biological transformations at the molecular level. In principle, the heat dissipated by each nanoparticle might produce a temperature increase in its proximity, facilitating a change in the molecules directly attached to it but not in the others. Although this method has been demonstrated to provide control over biological transformations, the proposed mechanism involves producing and maintaining large temperature differences across small distances, in the range of several degrees Celsius across tens of nanometers. Existing theories for heat generation and transfer in rf heated nanoparticle systems cannot account for these gradients. To better understand the limitations of local heating, the temperature in the vicinity of rf heated nanoparticles was measured. Dilute aqueous suspensions of gold and magnetite nanoparticles were remotely heated by an rf field between 600–800 kHz. Two systems were investigated: a control sample consisting of quantum dots mixed with nanoparticles and a solution of quantum dots covalently linked to nanoparticles. The temperature of the fluorescent probes represents the average temperature in the former and the local temperature in the later. For the experimental conditions employed in this study, the measured temperature rise in the vicinity of rf heated nanoparticles were similar to the average or “bulk” temperature, in agreement with theoretical predictions.},

abstract = {MspA is an extremely stable, oligomeric porin from Mycobacterium smegmatis that forms water-filled channels in vitro. Immunogold electron microscopy and an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay demonstrated that MspA is localized in the cell wall. An mspA deletion mutant did not synthesize detectable amounts of mspA mRNA, as revealed by amplification using mspA-specific primers and reverse-transcribed RNA. Detergent extracts of the DeltamspA mutant exhibited a significantly lower porin activity in lipid bilayer experiments and contained about fourfold less porin than extracts of wild-type M. smegmatis. The chromosome of M. smegmatis encodes three proteins very similar to MspA. Sequence analysis of the purified porin revealed that mspB or mspC or both genes are expressed in the DeltamspA mutant. The properties of this porin, such as single channel conductance, extreme stability against denaturation, molecular mass and composition of 20 kDa subunits, are identical to those of MspA. Deletion of mspA reduced the cell wall permeability towards cephaloridine and glucose nine- and fourfold respectively. These results show that MspA is the main general diffusion pathway for hydrophilic molecules in M. smegmatis and was only partially replaced by fewer porins in the cell wall of the DeltamspA mutant [corrected] This is the first experimental evidence that porins are the major determinants of the exceptionally low permeability of mycobacteria to hydrophilic molecules.},

To mitigate the membrane fluctuations and pin-hole defects, a SiNx membrane is transferred onto the substrate and a pore of approximately 70 nm in diameter is perforated prior to the graphene transfer. Comprehensive noise study reveals that the few layer graphene transferred onto the quartz substrate possesses low noise level and higher signal to noise ratio as compared to single layer graphene, without deteriorating the spatial resolution.

By screening natural microbial communities exposed to PET in the environment, we isolated a novel bacterium, Ideonella sakaiensis 201-F6, that is able to use PET as its major energy and carbon source. When grown on PET, this strain produces two enzymes capable of hydrolyzing PET and the reaction intermediate, mono(2-hydroxyethyl) terephthalic acid. Both enzymes are required to enzymatically convert PET efficiently into its two environmentally benign monomers, terephthalic acid and ethylene glycol.},

They consider the cases of nanopore surface charge being opposite to the charge of the translocating polymer. The authors show that, because of the high electric field across the nanopore in DNA translocation experiments, electro-osmotic flow is able to create an absorbing region comparable to the size of the polymer around the nanopore. Within this capturing region, the velocity gradient of the fluid flow is high enough for the polymer to undergo coil-stretch transition. The stretched conformation reduces the entropic barrier of translocation. The diffusion limited translocation rate is found to be proportional to the applied voltage. In the authors' theory, many experimental variables (electric field, surface potential, pore radius, dielectric constant, temperature, and salt concentration) appear through a single universal parameter. They have made quantitative predictions on the size of the adsorption region near the pore for the polymer and on the rate of translocation.},

Recently, P3-1-(2-nitro phenylethyladenosine 5'-triphosphate "caged ATP" was synthesized and its photolysis was shown to generate ATP in situ. This and related reactions have great potential for structural and kinetic studies of both intact and soluble biological systems and it is thus important to define the kinetic characteristics of the photolytic reaction. Caged ATP (2.5 mM) was photolyzed at 347 nm by a single 30-nsec pulse from a frequency-doubled ruby laser of 25 mJ energy to generate 500 microM ATP. The kinetics of the overall reaction were determined by monitoring the kinetics of ATP-induced dissociation of actomyosin, a reaction of known kinetic characteristics. Release of 500 microM ATP was found to be controlled by a process having a rate constant of 2.2 X 10(9) [H+] sec-1 at 22 degrees C at pH 5.8-9.5, which corresponds to 220 sec-1 at pH 7. This process is believed to be the breakdown of an aci-nitro compound, which was identified on the basis of its spectral properties and the photochromicity of related 2-nitrobenzyl compounds.},

abstract = {Much more than ever, nucleic acids are recognized as key building blocks in many of life's processes, and the science of studying these molecular wonders at the single-molecule level is thriving. A new method of doing so has been introduced in the mid 1990's. This method is exceedingly simple: a nanoscale pore that spans across an impermeable thin membrane is placed between two chambers that contain an electrolyte, and voltage is applied across the membrane using two electrodes. These conditions lead to a steady stream of ion flow across the pore. Nucleic acid molecules in solution can be driven through the pore, and structural features of the biomolecules are observed as measurable changes in the trans-membrane ion current. In essence, a nanopore is a high-throughput ion microscope and a single-molecule force apparatus. Nanopores are taking center stage as a tool that promises to read a DNA sequence, and this promise has resulted in overwhelming academic, industrial, and national interest. Regardless of the fate of future nanopore applications, in the process of this 16-year-long exploration, many studies have validated the indispensability of nanopores in the toolkit of single-molecule biophysics. This review surveys past and current studies related to nucleic acid biophysics, and will hopefully provoke a discussion of immediate and future prospects for the field.},

As approximately four nucleotides affect the ion current of each level, we measured the ion current corresponding to all 256 four-nucleotide combinations (quadromers). This quadromer map is highly predictive of ion current levels of previously unmeasured sequences derived from the bacteriophage phi X 174 genome. Furthermore, we show nanopore sequencing reads of phi X 174 up to 4,500 bases in length, which can be unambiguously aligned to the phi X 174 reference genome, and demonstrate proof-of-concept utility with respect to hybrid genome assembly and polymorphism detection.

abstract = {Background: Some G-rich sequences fold into intramolecular quadruplex structures. Pif1 helicase reduces genomic insta-bility by unfolding quadruplex DNA. Results: Pif1 unfolds a parallel quadruplex structure slowly relative to unwinding of duplex DNA. Conclusion: Comparison of duplex unwinding to quadruplex unfolding is complicated by distinct kinetic mechanisms. Significance: A highly stable, intramolecular quadruplex is a formidable obstacle but can be overcome by Pif1 helicase. DNA sequences that can form intramolecular quadruplex structures are found in promoters of proto-oncogenes. Many of these sequences readily fold into parallel quadruplexes. Here we characterize the ability of yeast Pif1 to bind and unfold a parallel quadruplex DNA substrate. We found that Pif1 binds more tightly to the parallel quadruplex DNA than single-stranded DNA or tailed duplexes. However, Pif1 unwinding of duplexes occurs at a much faster rate than unfolding of a parallel intra-molecular quadruplex. Pif1 readily unfolds a parallel quadru-plex DNA substrate in a multiturnover reaction and also gener-ates some product under single cycle conditions. The rate of ATP hydrolysis by Pif1 is reduced when bound to a parallel quadruplex compared with single-stranded DNA. ATP hydro-lysis occurs at a faster rate than quadruplex unfolding, indicat-ing that some ATP hydrolysis events are non-productive during unfolding of intramolecular parallel quadruplex DNA. How-ever, product eventually accumulates at a slow rate.},

abstract = {Chemotaxis, the chemically guided movement of cells, plays an important role in several biological processes including cancer, wound healing, and embryogenesis. Chemotacting cells are able to sense shallow chemical gradients where the concentration of chemoattractant differs by only a few percent from one side of the cell to the other, over a wide range of local concentrations. Exactly what limits the chemotactic ability of these cells is presently unclear. Here we determine the chemotactic response of Dictyostelium cells to exponential gradients of varying steepness and local concentration of the chemoattractant cAMP. We find that the cells are sensitive to the steepness of the gradient as well as to the local concentration. Using information theory techniques, we derive a formula for the mutual information between the input gradient and the spatial distribution of bound receptors and also compute the mutual information between the input gradient and the motility direction in the experiments. A comparison between these quantities reveals that for shallow gradients, in which the concentration difference between the back and the front of a 10-mum-diameter cell is {\textless}5{\%}, and for small local concentrations ({\textless}10 nM) the intracellular information loss is insignificant. Thus, external fluctuations due to the finite number of receptors dominate and limit the chemotactic response. For steeper gradients and higher local concentrations, the intracellular information processing is suboptimal and results in a smaller mutual information between the input gradient and the motility direction than would have been predicted from the ligand-receptor binding process.},

abstract = {Active transport driven by molecular motors is a key technology for the continued miniaturization of lab-on-a-chip devices, because it is expected to enable nanofluidic devices with channel diameters of less than 1 microm and total channel lengths on the order of 1 mm. An important metric for a transport mechanism employed in an analytic device is dispersion, because it critically affects the sensitivity and resolution. Here, we investigate the mechanisms responsible for the dispersion of a swarm of "molecular shuttles", consisting of functionalized microtubules propelled by surface-adhered kinesin motor proteins. Using a simple model and measurements of the path persistence length, motional diffusion coefficient, and the distribution of average velocities, we found that, at the time scale relevant in the envisioned nanobiodevices, variations in the time-averaged velocities between shuttles will make a stronger contribution to the dispersion of the swarm than both the fluctuations around the time-averaged velocity of an individual shuttle and the fluctuations in path length due to wiggling within the channel. Overall, the dispersion of such molecular shuttles is comparable to the dispersion of a sample plug transported by electroosmotic flow.},

@article{Liu2013,
abstract = {Single-molecule studies can overcome the complications of asynchrony and ensemble-averaging in bulk-phase measurements, provide mechanistic insights into molecular activities, and reveal interesting variations between individual molecules. The application of these techniques to the RecBCD helicase of Escherichia coli has resolved some long-standing discrepancies, and has provided otherwise unattainable mechanistic insights into its enzymatic behaviour. Enigmatically, the DNA unwinding rates of individual enzyme molecules are seen to vary considerably, but the origin of this heterogeneity remains unknown. Here we investigate the physical basis for this behaviour. Although any individual RecBCD molecule unwound DNA at a constant rate for an average of approximately 30,000 steps, we discover that transiently halting a single enzyme-DNA complex by depleting Mg(2+)-ATP could change the subsequent rates of DNA unwinding by that enzyme after reintroduction to ligand. The proportion of molecules that changed rate increased exponentially with the duration of the interruption, with a half-life of approximately 1 second, suggesting that a conformational change occurred during the time that the molecule was arrested. The velocity after pausing an individual molecule was any velocity found in the starting distribution of the ensemble. We suggest that substrate binding stabilizes the enzyme in one of many equilibrium conformational sub-states that determine the rate-limiting translocation behaviour of each RecBCD molecule. Each stabilized sub-state can persist for the duration (approximately 1 minute) of processive unwinding of a DNA molecule, comprising tens of thousands of catalytic steps, each of which is much faster than the time needed for the conformational change required to alter kinetic behaviour. This ligand-dependent stabilization of rate-defining conformational sub-states results in seemingly static molecule-to-molecule variation in RecBCD helicase activity, but in fact reflects one microstate from the equilibrium ensemble that a single molecule manifests during an individual processive translocation event.},

@article{Leroy1988,
abstract = {Using nuclear magnetic resonance line broadening, longitudinal relaxation and magnetization transfer from water, we have measured the imino proton exchange times in the duplex form of the 10-mer d-CGCGATCGCG and in seven other deoxy-duplexes, as a function of the concentration of exchange catalysts, principally ammonia. All exchange times are catalyst dependent. Base-pair lifetimes are obtained by extrapolation to infinite concentration of ammonia. Lifetimes of internal base-pairs are in the range of milliseconds at 35 degrees C and ten times more at 0 degrees C. Lifetimes of neighboring pairs are different, hence base-pairs open one at a time. Lifetimes of d(G.C) are about three times longer than those of d(A.T). The nature of neighbors usually has little effect, but lifetime anomalies that may be related to sequence and/or structure have been observed. In contrast, there is no anomaly in the A.T base-pair lifetimes of d-CGCGA[TA]5TCGCG, a model duplex of poly[d(A-T)].poly[d(A-T)]. The d(A.T) lifetimes are comparable to those of r(A.U) that we reported previously. End effects on base-pair lifetimes are limited to two base-pairs. The low efficiency of exchange catalysts is ascribed to the small dissociation constant of the deoxy base-pairs, and helps to explain why exchange catalysis had been overlooked in the past. This resulted in a hundredfold overestimation of base-pair lifetimes. Cytosine amino proteins have been studied in the duplex of d-CGm5CGCG. Exchange from the closed base-pair is indicated. Hence, the use of an amino exchange rate to evaluate the base-pair dissociation constant would result in erroneous, overestimated values. Catalyzed imino proton exchange is at this time the safest and most powerful, if not the only probe of base-pair kinetics. We propose that the single base-pair opening event characterized here may be the only mode of base-pair disruption, at temperatures well below the melting transition.},

Using classical molecular dynamics, we report the desalination performance of such membranes as a function of pore size, chemical functionalization, and applied pressure. Our results indicate that the membrane's ability to prevent the salt passage depends critically on pore diameter with adequately sized pores allowing for water flow while blocking ions. Further, an investigation into the role of chemical functional groups bonded to the edges of graphene pores suggests that commonly occurring hydroxyl groups can roughly double the water flux thanks to their hydrophilic character. The increase in water flux comes at the expense of less consistent salt rejection performance, which we attribute to the ability of hydroxyl functional groups to substitute for water molecules in the hydration shell of the ions. Overall, our results indicate that the water permeability of this material is several orders of magnitude higher than conventional reverse osmosis membranes, and that nanoporous graphene may have a valuable role to play for water purification.},

Here, we show that serial replication of individual DNA templates can be achieved by DNA polymerases held at the $\alpha$-haemolysin nanopore orifice. Replication is blocked in the bulk phase, and is initiated only after the DNA is captured by the nanopore. We used this method, in concert with active voltage control, to observe DNA replication catalysed by bacteriophage T7 DNA polymerase (T7DNAP) and by the Klenow fragment of DNA polymerase I (KF). T7DNAP advanced on a DNA template against an 80-mV load applied across the nanopore, and single nucleotide additions were measured on the millisecond timescale for hundreds of individual DNA molecules in series. Replication by KF was not observed when this enzyme was held on top of the nanopore orifice at an applied potential of 80 mV. Sequential nucleotide additions by KF were observed upon applying controlled voltage reversals.},

abstract = {Peptide nucleic acid (PNA) is a DNA mimic in which the nucleobases are linked by an N-(2-aminoethyl) glycine backbone. Here we report that PNA can interact with single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) in a non-sequence-specific fashion. We observed that a 15mer PNA inhibited the ssDNA-stimulated ATPase activity of a bacteriophage T4 helicase, Dda. Surprisingly, when a fluorescein-labeled 15mer PNA was used in binding studies no interaction was observed between PNA and Dda. However, fluorescence polarization did reveal non-sequence-specific interactions between PNA and ssDNA. Thus, the inhibition of ATPase activity of Dda appears to result from depletion of the available ssDNA due to non-Watson-Crick binding of PNA to ssDNA. Inhibition of the ssDNA-stimulated ATPase activity was observed for several PNAs of varying length and sequence. To study the basis for this phenomenon, we examined self-aggregation by PNAs. The 15mer PNA readily self-aggregates to the point of precipitation. Since PNAs are hydrophobic, they aggregate more than DNA or RNA, making the study of this phenomenon essential for understanding the properties of PNA. Non-sequence-specific interactions between PNA and ssDNA were observed at moderate concentrations of PNA, suggesting that such interactions should be considered for antisense and antigene applications.},

However, no current technique can simultaneously generate stable chemical gradients and allow fast gradient changes. We developed a microfluidic system with microstructured membranes for exposing neutrophils to fast and precise changes between stable, linear gradients of the known chemoattractant Interleukin-8 (IL-8). We observed that rapidly lowering the average concentration of IL-8 within a gradient, while preserving the direction of the gradient, resulted in temporary neutrophil depolarization. Fast reversal of the gradient direction while increasing or decreasing the average concentration also resulted in temporary depolarization. Neutrophils adapted and maintained their directional motility, only when the average gradient concentration was increased and the direction of the gradient preserved. Based on these observations we propose a two-component temporal sensing mechanism that uses variations of chemokine concentration averaged over the entire cell surface and localized at the leading edge, respectively, and directs neutrophil responses to changes in their chemical microenvironment.},

abstract = {The kinesin heavy chain and the ncd (non-claret disjunctional) gene product of Drosophila are microtubule-associated motor proteins related by sequence similarity within an approximately 340-aa domain. Despite the sequence similarity, the kinesin heavy chain and ncd protein move in opposite directions on microtubules. To investigate the molecular basis for direction of movement, we created a series of truncated kinesin heavy chain and ncd proteins. We found that the conserved domain of both proteins has microtubule motor activity, although the efficiency with which ATP hydrolysis is coupled to microtubule movement declines dramatically with increasing truncation. Further, the direction of movement is intrinsic to the conserved motor domains, rather than being a consequence of domain organization or adjacent sequences.},

The statistical properties of the paths followed by the filaments depend both on the motors (their surface concentration and mode of action) and on the filaments (their length and rigidity). By analyzing the dynamics of this system, we determine these dependencies and suggest how they may be used to infer more accurate quantitative information about motor proteins than is currently extracted from gliding assays.},

abstract = {The mobilities of various DNA fragments in two normally migrating molecular weight ladders were studied in polyacrylamide gels containing different concentrations of the crosslinker N,N'-methylenebisacrylamide (Bis). The acrylamide concentration ranged from 2.5-10.5{\%}T (w/v); the Bis concentration ranged from 0.5-10{\%}C (w/w), with respect to total acrylamide. Ferguson plots were constructed for each of the DNA fragments in gels of each composition. The Ferguson plots of the different multimers in each molecular weight ladder were nearly parallel in gels containing 0.5-3{\%}C, converged close to a common intercept at zero gel concentration in gels containing 4{\%}C, and crossed at approximately 1.5{\%}T in gels containing 5 and 10{\%}C. If the mobilities observed for the different DNA fragments at zero gel concentration were also extrapolated to zero DNA molecular weight, a common limiting mobility was observed in gels of all crosslinker concentrations. This limiting mobility was approximately equal to the free solution mobility of DNA. The effective pore radius of each gel was estimated from Ferguson plots based on relative mobilities, using the mobility of the smallest DNA fragment in each molecular weight ladder as the reference mobility. The calculated gel pore radii ranged from 142 nm to 19 nm, respectively, for gels containing 4.6{\%}T, 1.5{\%}C, and 10.5{\%}T, 5 or 10{\%}C. These pore radii are an order of magnitude larger than previously accepted values, but are consistent with scanning electron microscope measurements (R{\"{u}}chel, R., et al., J.

Our goal is to characterize the conformational changes of hepatitis C virus (HCV) helicase at different stages of ATPase cycle and to determine how they lead to translocation. We have reported that ATP binding reduces HCV helicase affinity for nucleic acid. Now we identify the stage of the ATPase cycle responsible for translocation and unwinding. We show that a rapid directional movement occurs upon helicase binding to DNA in the absence of ATP, resulting in opening of several base pairs. We propose that HCV helicase translocates as a Brownian motor with a simple two-stroke cycle. The directional movement step is fueled by single-stranded DNA binding energy while ATP binding allows for a brief period of random movement that prepares the helicase for the next cycle.},

Here, we investigate DNA translocations through a novel type of plasmonic nanopore based on a gold bowtie nanoantenna with a solid-state nanopore at the plasmonic hot spot. Plasmonic excitation of the nanopore is found to influence both the sensor signal (nanopore ionic conductance blockade during DNA translocation) and the process that captures DNA into the nanopore, without affecting the duration time of the translocations. Most striking is a strong plasmon-induced enhancement of the rate of DNA translocation events in lithium chloride (LiCl, already 10-fold enhancement at a few mW of laser power). This provides a means to utilize the excellent spatiotemporal resolution of DNA interrogations with nanopores in LiCl buffers, which is known to suffer from low event rates. We propose a mechanism based on plasmon-induced local heating and thermophoresis as explanation of our observations.},

Decreasing the energy requirements and infrastructure costs of existing desalination technologies remains a challenge. By enabling the manipulation of matter and control of transport at nanometer length scales, the emergence of nanotechnology offers new opportunities to advance water desalination technologies. This review focuses on nanostructured materials that are directly involved in the separation of water from salt as opposed to mitigating issues such as fouling. We discuss separation mechanisms and novel transport phenomena in materials including zeolites, carbon nanotubes, and graphene with potential applications to reverse osmosis, capacitive deionization, and multi-stage flash, among others. Such nanostructured materials can potentially enable the development of next-generation desalination systems with increased efficiency and capacity.},

abstract = {Helicases catalyze the separation of double-stranded nucleic acids to form single-stranded intermediates. Using transient state kinetic methods, we have determined the kinetic properties of DNA unwinding under conditions that favor a monomeric form of the Dda helicase as well as conditions that allow multiple molecules to function on the same substrate. Multiple helicase molecules can align like a train on the DNA track. The number of base pairs unwound in a single binding event for Dda is increased from approximately 19 bp for the monomeric form to approximately 64 bp when as many as four Dda molecules are aligned on the same substrate, while the kinetic step size (3.2 +/- 0.7 bp) and unwinding rate (242 +/- 25 bp/s) appear to be independent of the number of Dda molecules present on a given substrate. The data support a model in which the helicase molecules bound to the same substrate move along the DNA track independently during DNA unwinding. The observed increase in processivity arises from the increased probability that at least one of the helicases will completely unwind the DNA prior to dissociation. These results are in contrast to previous reports in which multiple Dda molecules on the same track greatly enhanced the rate and amplitude for displacement of protein blocks on the track. Therefore, only when the progress of the lead molecule in the train is impeded by some type of block, such as a protein bound to DNA, do the trailing molecules interact with the lead molecule to overcome the block. The fact that trailing helicase molecules have little impact on the lead molecule in the train during routine DNA unwinding suggests that the trailing molecules are moving at rates similar to that of the lead molecule. This result implicates a step in the translocation mechanism as contributing greatly to the overall rate-limiting step for unwinding of duplex DNA.},

Time-resolved measurements of the emission spectrum have been extended to a six decade time range (40 fs to 40 ns) by combining results from time-correlated photon counting, fluorescence up-conversion, and transient absorption. Recent results showed that when the reporter is placed in the center of the oligonucleotide, the dynamics are very broadly distributed over this entire time range and do not show specific time constants associated with individual processes (Andreatta, D.; et al. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2005, 127, 7270). This paper examines an oligonucleotide with the reporter near its end. The broadly distributed relaxation seen before remains with little attenuation. In addition, a new relaxation with a well-defined relaxation time of 5 ps appears. This process is assigned to the rapid component of "fraying" at the end of the helix.},

abstract = {Covalent single-chain dimers of the chemokine interleukin-8 (IL-8) have been designed to mimic the dimeric form of IL-8 in solution and facilitate the production of heterodimer variants of IL-8. Physical studies indicated that use of a simple peptide linker to join two subunits, while allowing receptor binding and activation, led to self-association of the tethered dimers. However, addition of a single disulfide crosslink between the tethered subunits prevented this multimer from forming, yielding a species of dimer molecular weight. Crosslinked single-chain dimers bind to both IL-8 neutrophil receptors CXCR1 and CXCR2 as well as to DARC, as does a double disulfide-linked dimer with no peptide linker. In addition, neutrophil response to these dimers as measured by chemotaxis or beta-glucuronidase release is similar to that elicited by wild-type IL-8, providing evidence that the dissociation of the dimeric species is not required for these biologically relevant activities. Finally, through construction of single-chain heterodimer mutants, we show that only the first subunit's ELR motif is the single-chain variants.},

In con- trast, biochemical reactions in living systems take place in media containing substantially greater total concentrations (50400 mg/ml) of macromolecules that may be present in solution and/or in indefinitely large arrays (e.g. cytoskeletal fibers) (1, 2). Because no single macromolecular species may be present at high concentration, but all species taken together occupy a significant fraction of the volume of the medium, such media are referred to as crowded (3) and/or confining (4) rather than concentrated, depending upon whether the mac- rosolutes are soluble and/or structured. Fig. 1 provides a sche- matic illustration of crowding and confinement in eukaryotic cytoplasm. In such media, nonspecific interactions between macrosolutes contribute significantly to the total free energy of the medium. High concentrations of background macromole- cules that do not participate directly in a particular test reac- tion have been observed to induce order-of-magnitude or greater changes in the rates and equilibria of numerous test reactions (see below). To properly assess the physiological role of a particular reaction or set of reactions characterized in vitro, it is important to consider the possible influence of crowd- ing and/or confinement upon the reaction in its physiological milieu.

abstract = {Porins form channels in the mycolic acid layer of mycobacteria and thereby control access of hydrophilic molecules to the cell. We purified a 100 kDa protein from Mycobacterium smegmatis and demonstrated its channel-forming activity by reconstitution in planar lipid bilayers. The mspA gene encodes a mature protein of 184 amino acids and an N-terminal signal sequence. MALDI mass spectrometry of the purified porin revealed a mass of 19 406 Da, in agreement with the predicted mass of mature MspA. Dissociation of the porin by boiling in 80{\%} dimethyl sulphoxide yielded the MspA monomer, which did not form channels any more. Escherichia coli cells expressing the mspA gene produced the MspA monomer and a 100 kDa protein, which had the same channel-forming activity as whole-cell extracts of M. smegmatis with organic solvents. These proteins were specifically detected by a polyclonal antiserum that was raised to purified MspA of M. smegmatis. These results demonstrate that the mspA gene encodes a protein of M. smegmatis, which assembles to an extremely stable oligomer with high channel-forming activity. Database searches did not reveal significant similarities to any other known protein. Southern blots showed that the chromosomes of fast-growing mycobacterial species contain homologous sequences to mspA, whereas no hybridization could be detected with DNA from slow growing mycobacteria. These results suggest that MspA is the prototype of a new class of channel-forming proteins.},

When attached to a substrate surface, these motors are envisioned to shuttle cargo that is bound to reconstituted microtubules--one component of the cell cytoskeleton--from one location to another. One potentially serious problem for such applications is, however, the rotation of the microtubules around their longitudinal axis. Here we explore this issue by labelling the gliding microtubules with quantum dots to simultaneously follow their sinusoidal side-to-side and up-and-down motion in three dimensions with nanometre accuracy. Microtubule rotation, which originates from the kinesin moving along the individual protofilaments of the microtubule, was not impeded by the quantum dots. However, pick-up of large cargo inhibited the rotation but did not affect the velocity of microtubule gliding. Our data show that kinesin-driven microtubules make flexible, responsive and effective molecular shuttles for nanotransport applications.},

abstract = {An emerging DNA sequencing technique uses protein or solid-state pores to analyze individual strands as they are driven in single-file order past a nanoscale sensor. However, uncontrolled electrophoresis of DNA through these nanopores is too fast for accurate base reads. Here, we describe forward and reverse ratcheting of DNA templates through the $\alpha$-hemolysin nanopore controlled by phi29 DNA polymerase without the need for active voltage control. DNA strands were ratcheted through the pore at median rates of 2.5-40 nucleotides per second and were examined at one nucleotide spatial precision in real time. Up to 500 molecules were processed at ∼130 molecules per hour through one pore. The probability of a registry error (an insertion or deletion) at individual positions during one pass along the template strand ranged from 10{\%} to 24.5{\%} without optimization. This strategy facilitates multiple reads of individual strands and is transferable to other nanopore devices for implementation of DNA sequence analysis.},

abstract = {We present the use of an alternating current (AC) signal as a means to monitor the conductance of an alpha-hemolysin (alphaHL) pore as a DNA hairpin with a polydeoxyadenosine tail is driven into and released from the pore. Specifically, a 12 base pair DNA hairpin attached to a 50-nucleotide poly-A tail (HP-A(50)) is threaded into an alphaHL channel using a DC driving voltage. Once the HP-A(50) molecule is trapped within the alphaHL channel, the DC driving voltage is turned off and the conductance of the channel is monitored using an AC voltage. The escape time, defined as the time it takes the HP-A(50) molecule to transport out of the alphaHL channel, is then measured. This escape time has been monitored as a function of AC amplitude (20 to 250 mV(ac)), AC frequency (60-200 kHz), DC drive voltage (0 to 100 mV(dc)), and temperature (-10 to 20 degrees C), in order to determine their effect on the predominantly diffusive motion of the DNA through the nanopore. The applied AC voltage used to monitor the conductance of the nanopore has been found to play a significant role in the DNA/nanopore interaction. The experimental results are described by a one-dimensional asymmetric periodic potential model that includes the influence of the AC voltage. An activation enthalpy barrier of 1.74 x 10(-19) J and a periodic potential asymmetry parameter of 0.575 are obtained for the diffusion at zero electrical bias of a single nucleotide through alphaHL.},

Our long-term objective is to take this molecular transport machinery and integrate it into kinesin-powered microdevices. As a step toward this objective, we have coupled kinesin to microscale silicon chips that were patterned photolithographically and etched from silicon membranes. The microchips were observed by light microscopy to move on microtubules aligned and immobilized on the surface of a microscope flowchamber. The microchips translated, rotated, and flipped over. From these examples of microchip movements, it is conceivable that this technology can be extended to moving more elaborate microparts, like gears, or rotors, or levers using kinesin motors. This will allow kinesin forces to be coupled to a useful action in a microdevice. For example, a microrotor turned by kinesin could demonstrate the feasibility of creating a kinesin-powered microgenerator or micropump.},

Stretch-activated ion chan- nels, caveolae, integrins, cadherins, growth factor re- ceptors, myosin motors, cytoskeletal filaments, nuclei, extracellular matrix, and numerous other structures and signaling molecules have all been shown to contrib- ute to the mechanotransduction response. However, little is known about how these different molecules function within the structural context of living cells, tissues, and organs to produce the orchestrated cellular behaviors required for mechanosensation, embryogen- esis, and physiological control. Recent work from a wide range of fields reveals that organ, tissue, and cell anatomy are as important for mechanotransduction as individual mechanosensitive proteins and that our bod- ies use structural hierarchies (systems within systems) composed of interconnected networks that span from the macroscale to the nanoscale in order to focus stresses on specific mechanotransducer molecules. The presence of isometric tension (prestress) at all levels of these multiscale networks ensures that various molecu- lar scale mechanochemical transduction mechanisms proceed simultaneously and produce a concerted re- sponse. Future research in this area will therefore require analysis, understanding, and modeling of ten- sionally integrated (tensegrity) systems of mechano- chemical control.},

The presence of a single abasic site within dsDNA that is in proximity to the latch zone (±2 nucleotides) results in a large increase in ion channel current, allowing accurate quantitation of the kinetics of base repair reactions involving an abasic site product. Taking advantage of the high resolution for abasic site recognition, the rate of uracil-DNA glycosylase hydrolysis of the N-glycosidic bond, converting 2'-deoxyuridine in DNA to an abasic site, was continuously monitored by electrophoretically capturing reaction substrate or product dsDNA in the ion channel vestibule.

abstract = {Helicase-catalyzed disruption of double-stranded nucleic acid is vital to DNA replication, recombination, and repair in all forms of life. The relative influence of specific chemical interactions between helicase and the substrate over a series of multistep catalytic events is still being defined. To this end, three modified DNA oligonucleotides were designed to serve as substrates for the bacteriophage T4 helicase, Dda. A 5'-DNA-PNA-DNA-3' chimera was synthesized, thereby, conferring both a loss of charge and altering the conformational flexibility of the oligonucleotide. The second modified oligonucleotide possessed a single methylphosphonate replacement on the phosphate backbone, creating a gap in the charge distribution of the substrate. The third modification introduced an abasic site into the oligonucleotide sequence. This abasic site retains the charge distribution of the normal DNA substrate yet alters the conformational flexibility of the oligonucleotide. The loss of a base also serves to disrupt the hydrogen-bonding lattice, the intramolecular base-stacking interactions, as well as the intermolecular base-stacking interactions between aromatic amino acid side chains and the substrate. Our results indicate that a gap in the charge distribution along the backbone of the substrate has a more pronounced effect upon helicase-catalyzed unwinding than does the loss of a single base. While all three substrates exhibited some degree of inhibition, analysis of both pre-steady-state and excess enzyme experiments places a greater value upon the electrostatic interactions between helicase and the substrate.},

Synthesis of the MT-templated Au nanowires was characterized using UV/vis spectroscopy and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). In addition, binding between the MT filaments and Au nanoparticles was investigated using surface enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS) and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) to establish the nature of the binding sites. A variety of functional groups were identified by SERS to interact with the Au including imidazole, sulfur, aromatic rings, amine, and carboxylate.

We show that there is a range of polymer lengths in which the system is approximately translationally invariant, and we develop a coarse-grained description of this regime. From this description, general features of the distribution of times for the polymer to pass through the pore may be deduced. We also introduce a more microscopic model. This model provides a physically reasonable scenario in which, as in experiments, the polymer's speed depends sensitively on its chemical composition, and even on its orientation in the channel. Finally, we point out that the experimental distribution of times for the polymer to pass through the pore is much broader than expected from simple estimates, and speculate on why this might be.},

abstract = {A computer adaptable method for finding similarities in the amino acid sequences of two proteins has been developed. From these findings it is possible to determine whether significant homology exists between the proteins. This information is used to trace their possible evolutionary development. The maximum match is a number dependent upon the similarity of the sequences. One of its definitions is the largest number of amino acids of one protein that can be matched with those of a second protein allowing for all possible interruptions in either of the sequences. While the interruptions give rise to a very large number of comparisons, the method efficiently excludes from consideration those comparisons that cannot contribute to the maximum match. Comparisons are made from the smallest unit of significance, a pair of amino acids, one from each protein. All possible pairs are represented by a two-dimensional array, and all possible comparisons are represented by pathways through the array. For this maximum match only certain of the possible pathways must be evaluated. A numerical value, one in this case, is assigned to every cell in the array representing like amino acids. The maximum match is the largest number that would result from summing the cell values of every pathway. ?? 1970.},

abstract = {Helicases utilize the energy of ATP hydrolysis to unwind double-stranded DNA while translocating on the DNA. Mechanisms for melting the duplex have been characterized as active or passive, depending on whether the enzyme actively separates the base pairs or simply sequesters single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) that forms due to thermal fraying. Here, we show that Dda translocates unidirectionally on ssDNA at the same rate at which it unwinds double-stranded DNA in both ensemble and single-molecule experiments. Further, the unwinding rate is largely insensitive to the duplex stability and to the applied force. Thus, Dda transduces all of its translocase activity into DNA unwinding activity so that the rate of unwinding is limited by the rate of translocation and that the enzyme actively separates the duplex. Active and passive helicases have been characterized by dividing the velocity of DNA unwinding in base pairs per second (V un) by the velocity of translocation on ssDNA in nucleotides per second (V trans). If the resulting fraction is 0.25, then a helicase is considered to be at the lower end of the active range. In the case of Dda, the average DNA unwinding velocity was 257 ± 42 bp/s, and the average translocation velocity was 267 ± 15 nt/s. The V un/V trans value of 0.96 places Dda in a unique category of being an essentially perfectly active helicase. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {Prolonging the lifetime of biomolecules in their functional states is critical for many applications where biomolecules are integrated into synthetic materials or devices. A simplified molecular shuttle system, which consists of fluorescently labelled microtubules propelled by kinesin motor proteins bound to the surface of a flowcell, served here as a model system to probe the lifetime of a hybrid device. In this system, the functional decay can easily be assayed by utilizing optical microscopy to detect motility and disintegration of microtubules. We found that the lifetimes of these hybrid systems were mainly limited by the stability of microtubules (MTs), rather than of kinesin. To determine the biocompatibility of polymers widely used in microfabrication, we assembled flowcells with glass bottom surfaces and covers fabricated from glass, poly(urethane) (PU), poly(methyl-methacrylate) (PMMA), poly(dimethylsiloxane) (PDMS) and ethylene-vinyl alcohol copolymer (EVOH).Without illumination, only PU had a substantial negative impact on MT stability, while PMMA, PDMS and EVOH showed stabilities comparable to glass. Under the influence of light, however, theMTs degraded rapidly in the presence of PDMS or PMMA, even in the presence of oxygen scavengers. A similar effect was observed on glass if oxygen scavengers were not added to the medium. Strong bleaching of the fluorophores was again only found on the polymer substrates and photobleaching coincided with an accelerated depolymerization of the MTs.},

The AFM technique readily discriminates differences in interaction force between the site-directed (Trp to Phe or Ala) mutants. The interaction force is poorly correlated with both the equilibrium free energy of biotin binding and the activation free energy barrier to dissociation of the biotin-streptavidin complex. The interaction force is generally well correlated with the equilibrium biotin-binding enthalpy as well as the enthalpic activation barrier, but in the one mutant where these two parameters are altered in opposite directions, the interaction force is clearly correlated with the activation enthalpy of dissociation. These results suggest that the AFM force measurements directly probe the enthalpic activation barrier to ligand dissociation.},

To advance our understanding of RNA folding and dynamics it is critical to know the flexibility of these un-base-paired regions and how it depends on counterions. Yet, information about nucleic acid polymer properties is mainly derived from studies of ssDNA. Here we measure the persistence lengths (l(p)) of ssRNA. We observe valence and ionic strength-dependent differences in l(p) in a direct comparison between 40-mers of deoxythymidylate (dT(40)) and uridylate (rU(40)) measured using the powerful combination of SAXS and smFRET. We also show that nucleic acid flexibility is influenced by local environment (an adjoining double helix). Our results illustrate the complex interplay between conformation and ion environment that modulates nucleic acid function in vivo.},

In this unique single-molecule tool, a phi29 DNA polymerase draws ssDNA through the pore in single-nucleotide steps, and the ion current through the pore is recorded. Comparing current levels generated with DNA containing methylated CpG sites to current levels obtained with unmethylated copies of the DNA reveals the precise location of methylated CpG sites. Hydroxymethylation is distinct from methylation and can also be mapped.

In this study, we developed a novel electroporation device using a capillary tip and a pipette that was effective on a wide range of mammalian cells, including cell lines, primary cells, and stem cells. The capillary electroporation system considerably reduced cell death during electroporation because of its wire-type electrode, which has a small surface area. The experimental results also indicated that the cell viability was dependent on the change in pH induced by electrolysis during electroporation. Additionally, the use of a long and narrow capillary tube combined with simple pipetting shortened the overall time of the electroporation process by up to 15 min, even under different conditions with 24 samples. These results were supported by comparison with a conventional electroporation system. The transfection rate and the cell viability were enhanced by the use of the capillary system, which had a high transfection rate of more than 80{\%} in general cell lines such as HeLa and COS-7, and more than 50{\%} in hard-to-transfect cells such as stem or primary cells. The viability was approximately 70-80{\%} in all cell types used in this study.},

The microtubule length distribution can be manipulated by growth conditions and post-processing (e.g. shearing). Using fluorescence microscopy, the length distribution is measured and shown to be a generalized Schulz distribution due to the independent and asymmetric growth from both ends. This situation can also arise for other cytoskeletal filaments, including actin filaments. Furthermore, exposure to shear flow is shown to reduce the average microtubule length but does not reduce the polydispersity index. Llikewise, annealing of microtubules increases average length but does not reduce polydispersity.

From the temporal ordering of the two levels within the bilevel current blockages, we infer whether individual A(25)C(50) and C(50)A(25) molecules pass through the pore in a 3'--{\textgreater}5' or 5'--{\textgreater}3' orientation. Correlation between the level of current obstruction and the inferred A(25)C(50) or C(50)A(25) orientation indicates that 3'--{\textgreater}5' translocation of a poly C segment causes a significantly deeper current obstruction than 5'--{\textgreater}3' translocation. Our analysis also suggests that the 3' ends of C(50) and A(25)C(50) RNA molecules are more likely to initiate translocation than the 5' ends. Orientation dependent differences in a smaller current blockage that immediately precedes many translocation events suggest that this blockage also contains information about RNA orientation during translocation. These findings emphasize that the directionality of polynucleotide molecules is an important factor in translocation and demonstrate how structure within ionic current signals can give new insights into the translocation process.},

abstract = {Motor proteins such as kinesin are used in cells to transport intracellular cargo along defined filament paths. The constituents of the transport system (i.e., motor proteins and filaments) can be reconstructed on synthetic surfaces to serve as molecular shuttles that actively transport cargo. Microfabricated open channels have been used in the past to guide microtubules propelled by kinesin adsorbed to the surface. In an effort to better understand the mechanism by which guidance occurs, we present a quantitative measure of the transport efficiency of microtubules along straight polyurethane channels 1 {\'{i}}m deep. Our analysis shows that the probability of a microtubule remaining in a channel drops exponentially as a function of its travel distance and that this characteristic decay distance varies with channel width. We identify microtubule-sidewall collisions as the key event for microtubule escape from a channel and thus the determinant of guiding efficiency. To better understand the relationship between collisions and travel distance, we determine the effect of channel width on (1) the microtubule approach angle to the sidewall, (2) the collision outcome (guided or escaped), and (3) the distance traveled between collisions. Also discussed is how the physical properties of microtubules or actin filaments (i.e., length, bending stiffness, persistence length) and changes in channel geometry (width, height) can describe measured parameters.},

An elementary "barometric" relation for the driving force is introduced that (i) applies to a range of kinetic and stochastic models, (ii) is consistent with more elaborate expressions entailing explicit representations of externally applied loads, and (iii) sufficiently close to thermal equlibrium, satisfies an Einstein-type relation in terms of the velocity and diffusion coefficient of the (load-free) motor. Even in the simplest two-state models, the velocity-vs.-load plots exhibit a variety of contrasting shapes (including nonmonotonic behavior). Previously suggested bounds on the driving force are shown to be inapplicable in general by analyzing discrete jump models with waiting time distributions.},

abstract = {The superfamily 1 helicase, RecD2, is a monomeric, bacterial enzyme with a role in DNA repair, but with 5'-3' activity unlike most enzymes from this superfamily. Rate constants were determined for steps within the ATPase cycle of RecD2 in the presence of ssDNA. The fluorescent ATP analog, mantATP (2'(3')-O-(N-methylanthraniloyl)ATP), was used throughout to provide a complete set of rate constants and determine the mechanism of the cycle for a single nucleotide species. Fluorescence stopped-flow measurements were used to determine rate constants for adenosine nucleotide binding and release, quenched-flow measurements were used for the hydrolytic cleavage step, and the fluorescent phosphate biosensor was used for phosphate release kinetics. Some rate constants could also be measured using the natural substrate, ATP, and these suggested a similar mechanism to that obtained with mantATP. The data show that a rearrangement linked to Mg(2+) coordination, which occurs before the hydrolysis step, is rate-limiting in the cycle and that this step is greatly accelerated by bound DNA. This is also shown here for the PcrA 3'-5' helicase and so may be a general mechanism governing superfamily 1 helicases. The mechanism accounts for the tight coupling between translocation and ATPase activity.},

Here, we build on recent progress with respect to nanopore resolution and DNA control to interpret the procession of ion current levels observed during the translocation of DNA through the pore MspA. As approximately four nucleotides affect the ion current of each level, we measured the ion current corresponding to all 256 four-nucleotide combinations (quadromers). This quadromer map is highly predictive of ion current levels of previously unmeasured sequences derived from the bacteriophage phi X 174 genome. Furthermore, we show nanopore sequencing reads of phi X 174 up to 4,500 bases in length, which can be unambiguously aligned to the phi X 174 reference genome, and demonstrate proof-of-concept utility with respect to hybrid genome assembly and polymorphism detection. This work provides a foundation for nanopore sequencing of long, natural DNA strands.},

abstract = {Control over interactions with biomolecules holds the key to applications of graphene in biotechnology. One such application is nanopore sequencing, where a DNA molecule is electrophoretically driven through a graphene nanopore. Here we investigate how interactions of single-stranded DNA and a graphene membrane can be controlled by electrically biasing the membrane. The results of our molecular dynamics simulations suggest that electric charge on graphene can force a DNA homopolymer to adopt a range of strikingly different conformations. The conformational response is sensitive to even very subtle nucleotide modifications, such as DNA methylation. The speed of DNA motion through a graphene nanopore is strongly affected by the graphene charge: a positive charge accelerates the motion, whereas a negative charge arrests it. As a possible application of the effect, we demonstrate stop-and-go transport of DNA controlled by the charge of graphene. Such on-demand transport of DNA is essential for realizing nanopore sequencing.},

We used NSOM to image fluorescently labeled plasma membranes of fixed human skin fibroblasts, either dried or in buffer. A patchy distribution of a fluorescent lipid analog suggestive of lipid domains was observed in the fixed, dried cells. The sizes of these patches were consistent with the sizes of domains implied by fluorescence photobleaching recovery measurements. Patches of fluorescent lipid analog were not spatially correlated with patches of transmembrane proteins, HLA class I molecules labeled with fluorescent antibody; the patchiness of the HLA class I molecules was on a smaller scale and was not localized to the same regions of membrane as the lipid analog. Sizes of HLA patches were deduced from a two-dimensional spatial autocorrelation analysis of NSOM images that resolved patches with radii of approximately 70 and approximately 600 nm on fixed, dried cells labeled with IgG and 300-600 nm on cells labeled with Fab and imaged in buffer. The large-size patches were also resolved by far-field microscopy. Both the spatial autocorrelation analysis and estimates from fluorescence intensity indicate that the small patches seen on fixed, dried cells contain approximately 25-125 HLA-I molecules each.},

Discrimination among the four canonical bases has been achieved, as has discrimination among cytosine, 5-methylcytosine (mC), and 5-hydroxymethylcytosine (hmC). Two additional modified cytosine bases, 5-carboxylcytosine (caC) and 5-formylcytosine (fC), are produced during enzymatic conversion of hmC to cytosine in mammalian cells. Thus, an accurate picture of the cytosine epigenetic status in target cells should also include these C5-cytosine variants. In the present study, we used a patch clamp amplifier to acquire ionic current traces caused by phi29 DNA polymerase-controlled translocation of DNA templates through the M2MspA pore. Decision boundaries based on three consecutive ionic current states were implemented to call mC, hmC, caC, fC, or cytosine at CG dinucleotides in ∼4400 individual DNA molecules. We found that the percentage of correct base calls for single pass reads ranged from 91.6{\%} to 98.3{\%}. This accuracy depended upon the identity of nearest neighbor bases surrounding the CG dinucleotide.},

Motion of this motor under low forces has been studied recently in various single-molecule assays. In this paper we show that myosin-V reacts to high forces as a mechanical ratchet. High backward loads can induce rapid and processive backward steps along the actin filament. This motion is completely independent of ATP binding and hydrolysis. In contrast, forward forces cannot induce ATP-independent forward steps. We can explain this pronounced mechanical asymmetry by a model in which the strength of actin binding of a motor head is modulated by the lever arm conformation. Knowledge of the complete force-velocity dependence of molecular motors is important to understand their function in the cellular environment.},

The sequencing of many genomes has revealed that they are rich in sequence motifs that have the potential to form G-quadruplexes and that their location is non-random, correlating with functionally important genomic regions. In this short review, we summarize recent evidence for the in vivo presence and function of DNA and RNA G-quadruplexes in various cellular pathways including DNA replication, gene expression and telomere maintenance. We also highlight remaining open questions that will have to be addressed in the future.},

abstract = {We present a refined model of the alpha beta-tubulin dimer to 3.5 A resolution. An improved experimental density for the zinc-induced tubulin sheets was obtained by adding 114 electron diffraction patterns at 40-60 degrees tilt and increasing the completeness of structure factor amplitudes to 84.7 {\%}. The refined structure was obtained using maximum-likelihood including phase information from experimental images, and simulated annealing Cartesian refinement to an R-factor of 23.2 and free R-factor of 29.7. The current model includes residues alpha:2-34, alpha:61-439, beta:2-437, one molecule of GTP, one of GDP, and one of taxol, as well as one magnesium ion at the non-exchangeable nucleotide site, and one putative zinc ion near the M-loop in the alpha-tubulin subunit. The acidic C-terminal tails could not be traced accurately, neither could the N-terminal loop including residues 35-60 in the alpha-subunit. There are no major changes in the overall fold of tubulin with respect to the previous structure, testifying to the quality of the initial experimental phases. The overall geometry of the model is, however, greatly improved, and the position of side-chains, especially those of exposed polar/charged groups, is much better defined. Three short protein sequence frame shifts were detected with respect to the non-refined structure. In light of the new model we discuss details of the tubulin structure such as nucleotide and taxol binding sites, lateral contacts in zinc-sheets, and the significance of the location of highly conserved residues.},

In particular, devices using cytoskeletal motor proteins for molecular transport are maturing. First efforts towards designing such devices used motor proteins attached to micro-structured substrates for the directed transport of microtubules and actin filaments. Soon thereafter, the specific capture, transport and detection of target analytes like viruses were demonstrated. Recently, spatial guiding of the gliding filaments was added to increase the sensitivity of detection and allow parallelization. Whereas molecular motor powered devices have not yet demonstrated performance beyond the level of existing detection techniques, the potential is great: Replacing microfluidics with transport powered by molecular motors allows integration of the energy source (ATP) into the assay solution. This opens up the opportunity to design highly integrated, miniaturized, autonomous detection devices. Such devices, in turn, may allow fast and cheap on-site diagnosis of diseases and detection of environmental pathogens and toxins.},

abstract = {Nucleotide penetration into the voltage-dependent mitochondrial ion channel (VDAC) reduces single-channel conductance and generates excess current noise through a fully open channel. VDAC channels were reconstituted into planar phospholipid membranes bathed in 1.0 M NaCl. At a given nucleotide concentration, the average decrease in small-ion channel conductance induced by mononucleotides ATP, ADP, AMP, and UTP and dinucleotides beta- and alpha-NADH, NAD, and NADPH are very close. However, the excess current noise is about seven times higher in the presence of NADPH than in the presence of ATP and is about 40 times higher than in the presence of UTP. The nucleotide-generated low-frequency noise obeys the following sequence: beta-NADPH {\textgreater} beta-NADH = alpha-NADH {\textgreater} ATP {\textgreater} ADP {\textgreater} beta-NAD {\textgreater} or = AMP {\textgreater} UTP. Measurements of bulk-phase diffusion coefficients and of the effective charge of the nucleotides in 1.0 M NaCl suggest that differences in size and charge cannot be the major factors responsible for the ability to generate current noise. Thus, although the ability of nucleotides to partition into the channel's pore, as assessed by the reduction in conductance, is very similar, the ability to generate current noise involves a detailed recognition of the three-dimensional structure of the nucleotide by the VDAC channel. A possible mechanism for this selectivity is two noise-generating processes operating in parallel.},

abstract = {Complexes formed between the bacteriophage phi29 DNA polymerase (DNAP) and DNA fluctuate between the pre-translocation and post-translocation states on the millisecond time scale. These fluctuations can be directly observed with single-nucleotide precision in real-time ionic current traces when individual complexes are captured atop the $\alpha$-hemolysin nanopore in an applied electric field. We recently quantified the equilibrium across the translocation step as a function of applied force (voltage), active-site proximal DNA sequences, and the binding of complementary dNTP. To gain insight into the mechanism of this step in the DNAP catalytic cycle, in this study, we have examined the stochastic dynamics of the translocation step. The survival probability of complexes in each of the two states decayed at a single exponential rate, indicating that the observed fluctuations are between two discrete states. We used a robust mathematical formulation based on the autocorrelation function to extract the forward and reverse rates of the transitions between the pre-translocation state and the post-translocation state from ionic current traces of captured phi29 DNAP-DNA binary complexes. We evaluated each transition rate as a function of applied voltage to examine the energy landscape of the phi29 DNAP translocation step. The analysis reveals that active-site proximal DNA sequences influence the depth of the pre-translocation and post-translocation state energy wells and affect the location of the transition state along the direction of the translocation.},

These materials have the potential to be produced at low cost and in large areas, while maintaining high material quality. These properties, as well as their flexibility, make two-dimensional atomic crystals attractive for applications such as solar cells or display panels. The basic building blocks of optoelectronic devices are p-n junction diodes, but they have not yet been demonstrated in a two-dimensional material. Here, we report a p-n junction diode based on an electrostatically doped tungsten diselenide (WSe2) monolayer. We present applications as a photovoltaic solar cell, a photodiode and a light-emitting diode, and obtain light-power conversion and electroluminescence efficiencies of ∼ 0.5{\%} and ∼ 0.1{\%}, respectively. Given recent advances in the large-scale production of two-dimensional crystals, we expect them to profoundly impact future developments in solar, lighting and display technologies.},

We verified that the mean time between capture events follows a simple exponential distribution, whereas the translocation times follow a unique distribution that is partly Gaussian and partly exponential. Measurements of polymer sequence effects demonstrated that translocation duration is heavily influenced by specific or nonspecific purine-channel interactions. The single molecule approach we used revealed molecular interactions that can influence both capture rates and translocation velocities in a manner that enriches naive barrier crossing models.},

abstract = {Glutaraldehyde-cross-linked microtubules were investigated as substrates for kinesin motility. Microtubules, formed in vitro from chicken brain tubulin, were stabilized with Taxol and chemically fixed with glutaraldehyde. The degree of tubulin monomer cross-linking as a function of time and glutaraldehyde concentration was characterized using polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Atomic force microscopy of fixed microtubules indicated that the cross-linking is sufficient to stabilize the gross structure of the microtubules against air drying or a distilled water challenge. Kinesin movement on immobilized, fixed microtubules was determined using a kinesin-coated bead motility assay observed with differential interference contrast microscopy. Within measurement error, kinesin bead movement velocities were independent of the degree of microtubule cross-linking. Binding affinity, however, decreased with increased cross-linking. Although air- and water-challenged microtubules did not support kinesin motility, a dilute suspension of glutaraldehyde-fixed microtubules in buffer supported kinesin motility for at least 2 days without any substantial degradation of activity. Fixed microtubules may be useful for several applications, including affinity purification of microtubule-associated proteins and motility measurements under extreme conditions of temperature and other variables.},

Although single base resolution and differentiation have been demonstrated with nanopores using ionic current measurements, direct sequencing has not been achieved because of the difficulties in recording very small ({\{}$\backslash$textasciitilde{\}}pA) ionic currents at a bandwidth consistent with fast translocation speeds. Here, we show that solid-state nanopores can be combined with silicon nanowire field-effect transistors to create sensors in which detection is localized and self-aligned at the nanopore. Well-defined field-effect transistor signals associated with DNA translocation are recorded when an ionic strength gradient is imposed across the nanopores. Measurements and modelling show that field-effect transistor signals are generated by highly localized changes in the electrical potential during DNA translocation, and that nanowire–nanopore sensors could enable large-scale integration with a high intrinsic bandwidth.},

Hemoglobin C (HbC) is a mutant hemoglobin that has increased oxidative susceptibility due to an amino acid substitution (beta6: Glu to Lys). The growth of Plasmodium falciparum is abnormal in homozygous CC erythrocytes in vitro, and CC individuals show innate protection against severe P. falciparum malaria. We investigated one possible mechanism of innate protection using a quantum dot technique to compare the distribution of host membrane band 3 molecules in genotypically normal (AA) to CC erythrocytes. The high photostability of quantum dots facilitated the construction of 3D cell images and the quantification of fluorescent signal intensity. Power spectra and 1D autocorrelation analyses showed band 3 clusters on the surface of infected AA and CC erythrocytes. These clusters became larger as the parasites matured and were more abundant in CC erythrocytes. Further, average cluster size (500 nm) in uninfected (native) CC erythrocytes was comparable with that of parasitized AA erythrocytes but was significantly larger (1 microm) in parasitized CC erythrocytes. Increased band 3 clustering may enhance recognition sites for autoantibodies, which could contribute to the protective effect of hemoglobin C against malaria.},

It is shown that the interactions that stabilize the double helix and the elastic rigidity of single strands simply determine the sequence-dependent approximately 12-pN force threshold for DNA strand separation. Using a semimicroscopic model of the binding between nucleotide strands, we show that the greater rigidity of the strands when formed into double-stranded DNA, relative to that of isolated strands, gives rise to a potential barrier to unzipping. The effects of this barrier are derived analytically. The force to keep the extremities of the molecule at a fixed distance, the kinetic rates for strand unpairing at fixed applied force, and the rupture force as a function of loading rate are calculated. The dependence of the kinetics and of the rupture force on molecule length is also analyzed.},

abstract = {Complexes of phi29 DNA polymerase and DNA fluctuate on the millisecond time scale between two ionic current amplitude states when captured atop the $\alpha$-hemolysin nanopore in an applied field. The lower amplitude state is stabilized by complementary dNTP and thus corresponds to complexes in the post-translocation state. We have demonstrated that in the upper amplitude state, the DNA is displaced by a distance of one nucleotide from the post-translocation state. We propose that the upper amplitude state corresponds to complexes in the pre-translocation state. Force exerted on the template strand biases the complexes toward the pre-translocation state. Based on the results of voltage and dNTP titrations, we concluded through mathematical modeling that complementary dNTP binds only to the post-translocation state, and we estimated the binding affinity. The equilibrium between the two states is influenced by active site-proximal DNA sequences. Consistent with the assignment of the upper amplitude state as the pre-translocation state, a DNA substrate that favors the pre-translocation state in complexes on the nanopore is a superior substrate in bulk phase for pyrophosphorolysis. There is also a correlation between DNA sequences that bias complexes toward the pre-translocation state and the rate of exonucleolysis in bulk phase, suggesting that during DNA synthesis the pathway for transfer of the primer strand from the polymerase to exonuclease active site initiates in the pre-translocation state.},

abstract = {Helicases and nucleic acid translocases are motor proteins that have essential roles in nearly all aspects of nucleic acid metabolism, ranging from DNA replication to chromatin remodelling. Fuelled by the binding and hydrolysis of nucleoside triphosphates, helicases move along nucleic acid filaments and separate double-stranded DNA into their complementary single strands. Recent evidence indicates that the ability to simply translocate along single-stranded DNA is, in many cases, insufficient for helicase activity. For some of these enzymes, self assembly and/or interactions with accessory proteins seem to regulate their translocase and helicase activities.},

@article{Lubensky2002,
abstract = {We present an extensive theoretical investigation of the mechanical unzipping of double-stranded DNA under the influence of an applied force. In the limit of long polymers, there is a thermodynamic unzipping transition at a critical force value of order 10 pN, with different critical behavior for homopolymers and for random heteropolymers. We extend results on the disorder-averaged behavior of DNA's with random sequences [D. K. Lubensky and D. R. Nelson, Phys. Rev. Lett. 85, 1572 (2000)] to the more experimentally accessible problem of unzipping a single DNA molecule. As the applied force approaches the critical value, the double-stranded DNA unravels in a series of discrete, sequence-dependent steps that allow it to reach successively deeper energy minima. Plots of extension versus force thus take the striking form of a series of plateaus separated by sharp jumps. Similar qualitative features should reappear in micromanipulation experiments on proteins and on folded RNA molecules. Despite their unusual form, the extension versus force curves for single molecules still reveal remnants of the disorder-averaged critical behavior. Above the transition, the dynamics of the unzipping fork is related to that of a particle diffusing in a random force field; anomalous, disorder-dominated behavior is expected until the applied force exceeds the critical value for unzipping by roughly 5 pN.},

However, currently available synthetic nanomaterials are generally used in their bulk form and control of nanosystems at the nanoscale on demand has not been realized. To solve this problem, the use of macroscopic mechanical stimuli to drive nano/molecular systems is considered to be a key technique. If direct manipulation of nano/molecular systems could be achieved by applying macroscopic mechanical stimuli, we might exert control over nanotechnological systems according to our needs. In this perspective, recent methodologies for controlling nano/molecular systems through application of macroscopic mechanical forces are introduced. Application of mechanical processes is known to affect some molecular association and chemical reactions, causing variation of optical properties, sometimes resulting in self-healing functions or capture and release of molecules under macroscopic mechanical motions. We might be able to realize the great potential of nanoscale and molecular systems by accessing nanoscience and nanotechnology from the macroscopic world.},

We also accomplished the extraction of unidirectional movement from the bidirectional movements along the linear tracks by adding arrowhead patterns on the tracks. These "rectifiers" enabled us to construct microminiturized circulators in which populations of microtubules rotated in one direction, and to actively transport microtubules between two pools connected by arrowheaded tracks in the fields of micrometer scales.},

U.S.A. 99, 14722] and streptavidin displacement [Byrd and Raney (2004) Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 11, 531]. However, its activity for streptavidin displacement increased as a function of the length of single-stranded DNA. We investigated whether Dda exhibited enhanced DNA unwinding of partially duplex DNA substrates as a function of increasing the length of the single-stranded overhangs. DNA substrates were prepared containing 16 base pairs and single-stranded overhangs of 4, 6, 8, 12, 16, 20, and 24 nucleotides. Under single turnover conditions in the presence of excess enzyme, the quantity of DNA unwound increased significantly as the length of the single strand overhang increased. Increased processivity was observed when the DNA substrate contained longer single-stranded overhangs. Equilibrium binding studies indicated that Dda bound to the substrates containing the longer overhangs significantly better than the shorter overhangs. To determine whether the increased processivity for unwinding was due to multiple molecules of Dda or due to the increased binding affinity to the longer overhangs, DNA unwinding was conducted under pre-steady-state conditions, which favor binding of monomeric Dda. Under pre-steady-state conditions, the quantity of product decreased somewhat as the single-stranded length increased, from 12 to 24 nucleotides. Thus, when monomeric Dda is required to translocate longer distances prior to unwinding, processivity is lowered. Taken together, these results indicate that enhanced binding to the longer single-stranded overhangs was not responsible for enhanced processivity under conditions of excess enzyme. Rather, multiple molecules of Dda bound to the same substrate exhibit greater processivity for DNA unwinding.},

abstract = {DNA abasic (AP) sites are one of the most frequent lesions in the genome and have a high mutagenic potential if unrepaired. After selective attachment of 2-aminomethyl-18-crown-6 (18c6), individual AP lesions are detected during electrophoretic translocation through the bacterial protein ion channel $\alpha$-hemolysin ($\alpha$-HL) embedded in a lipid bilayer. Interactions between 18c6 and Na(+) produce characteristic pulse-like current amplitude signatures that allow the identification of individual AP sites in single molecules of homopolymeric or heteropolymeric DNA sequences. The bulky 18c6-cation complexes also dramatically slow the DNA motion to more easily recordable levels. Further, the behaviors of the AP-18c6 adduct are different with respect to the directionalities of DNA entering the protein channel, and they can be precisely manipulated by altering the cation (Li(+), Na(+) or K(+)) of the electrolyte. This method permits detection of multiple AP lesions per strand, which is unprecedented in other work. Additionally, insights into the thermodynamics and kinetics of 18c6-cation interactions at a single-molecule level are provided by the nanopore measurement.},

In contrast to the recent X-ray crystallographic demonstration of a heptameric stoichiometry for the oligomer formed in deoxycholate (DOC) micelles, the high-resolution unprocessed AFM images unequivocally revealed a hexamer in these phospholipid bilayers. Independent support of this hexameric stoichiometry was obtained from the measurements of the lattice constant in the AFM images and from gel electrophoresis. Therefore, alpha HL can form two different, energetically stable oligomers, which differ in at least stoichiometry but perhaps subunit structure as well. Furthermore, stable, incomplete oligomers were observed in the AFM images, which may be of relevance to the mechanism by which alpha HL damages the cell.},

Because diffusion-based chemotaxis assays used in previous studies suffer from temporally changing gradients, it is difficult to distinguish the influence of CF gradient steepness from mean CF concentration on chemotaxis. To better understand the roles of mean CF concentration and CF gradient steepness, we developed a microfluidic device that can maintain stable IL-8 gradients. We report that the random motility of neutrophils is a biphasic function of IL-8 concentration and its magnitude plays a decisive role in effective chemotaxis, a quantitative measure of migration. We show that the concentrations for the optimum chemotaxis in linear IL-8 gradients and for the maximum random motility in uniform IL-8 coincide. In contrast, we find that the steepness of IL-8 gradients has no significant effect on effective chemotaxis.},

However, ionic current noise levels are several orders of magnitude larger than those for silicon nitride nanopores. These fluctuations are reduced with the atomic-layer deposition of 5 nm of titanium dioxide over the device. Unlike traditional solid-state nanopore materials that are insulating, graphene is an excellent electrical conductor.

A 160-fold variation of GFP expression levels in M. smegmatis was achieved by combining three promoters with different copy numbers of the vectors. An efficient energy transfer between BFP and GFP in M. smegmatis was observed by fluorescence measurements and demonstrated that these genes were simultaneously expressed from both vectors.

abstract = {Broad-spectrum analysis of DNA and RNA samples is of increasing importance in the growing field of biotechnology. We show that nanopore measurements may be used to assess the purity, phosphorylation state, and chemical integrity of nucleic acid preparations. In contrast with gel electrophoresis and mass spectrometry, an unprecedented dynamic range of DNA sizes and concentrations can be evaluated in a single data acquisition process that spans minutes. Because the molecule information is quantized and digitally recorded with single-molecule resolution, the sensitivity of the system can be adjusted in real time to detect trace amounts of a particular DNA species.},

abstract = {Devices in which a single strand of DNA is threaded through a nanopore could be used to efficiently sequence DNA. However, various issues will have to be resolved to make this approach practical, including controlling the DNA translocation rate, suppressing stochastic nucleobase motions, and resolving the signal overlap between different nucleobases. Here, we demonstrate theoretically the feasibility of DNA sequencing using a fluidic nanochannel functionalized with a graphene nanoribbon. This approach involves deciphering the changes that occur in the conductance of the nanoribbon as a result of its interactions with the nucleobases via $\pi$-$\pi$ stacking. We show that as a DNA strand passes through the nanochannel, the distinct conductance characteristics of the nanoribbon (calculated using a method based on density functional theory coupled to non-equilibrium Green function theory) allow the different nucleobases to be distinguished using a data-mining technique and a two-dimensional transient autocorrelation analysis. This fast and reliable DNA sequencing device should be experimentally feasible in the near future.},

abstract = {Nanopore sensors have attracted considerable interest for high-throughput sensing of individual nucleic acids and proteins without the need for chemical labels or complex optics. A prevailing problem in nanopore applications is that the transport kinetics of single biomolecules are often faster than the measurement time resolution. Methods to slow down biomolecular transport can be troublesome and are at odds with the natural goal of high-throughput sensing. Here we introduce a low-noise measurement platform that integrates a complementary metal-oxide semiconductor (CMOS) preamplifier with solid-state nanopores in thin silicon nitride membranes. With this platform we achieved a signal-to-noise ratio exceeding five at a bandwidth of 1 MHz, which to our knowledge is the highest bandwidth nanopore recording to date. We demonstrate transient signals as brief as 1 $\mu$s from short DNA molecules as well as current signatures during molecular passage events that shed light on submolecular DNA configurations in small nanopores.},

Here, we investigate the persistence length of short (approximately 0.1 microm) ends of microtubules by measuring the trajectories of kinesin-propelled microtubules under perpendicular electric forces. We relate the measured trajectory curvatures to the biased thermal fluctuations of the leading microtubule end, and upon including all electrohydrodynamic forces, we find that the persistence length of the microtubule ends is only 0.08 +/- 0.02 mm. This is significantly shorter than the well established value of approximately 4-8 mm that is measured for long microtubules. Our data are in good agreement with recent theoretical predictions that microtubules mechanically behave as a loose assembly of independent protofilaments on these short length scales.},

abstract = {We introduce a computational method for classification of individual DNA molecules measured by an alpha-hemolysin channel detector. We show classification with better than 99{\%} accuracy for DNA hairpin molecules that differ only in their terminal Watson-Crick basepairs. Signal classification was done in silico to establish performance metrics (i.e., where train and test data were of known type, via single-species data files). It was then performed in solution to assay real mixtures of DNA hairpins. Hidden Markov Models (HMMs) were used with Expectation/Maximization for denoising and for associating a feature vector with the ionic current blockade of the DNA molecule. Support Vector Machines (SVMs) were used as discriminators, and were the focus of off-line training. A multiclass SVM architecture was designed to place less discriminatory load on weaker discriminators, and novel SVM kernels were used to boost discrimination strength. The tuning on HMMs and SVMs enabled biophysical analysis of the captured molecule states and state transitions; structure revealed in the biophysical analysis was used for better feature selection.},

High-amplitude ( approximately 100-450 mV) rectangular voltage pulses were used to electroporate the bilayers, followed by a prolonged, low-amplitude ( approximately 65 mV) voltage clamp to monitor the ensuing changes in transmembrane conductance. The electroporation thresholds of the membranes were found for rectangular voltage pulses of given durations. The strength-duration relationship was determined over a range from 10 micros to 10 s. The addition of C12E8 at concentrations of 0.1, 1, and 10 microM to the bath surrounding the membranes decreased the electroporation threshold monotonically with concentration for all durations (p {\textless} 0.0001). The decrease from control values ranged from 10{\%} to 40{\%}, depending on surfactant concentration and pulse duration. For a 10-micros pulse, the transmembrane conductance 150 micros after electroporation (G150) increased monotonically with the surfactant concentration (p = 0.007 for 10 microM C12E8). These findings suggest that C12E8 incorporates into POPC bilayers, allowing electroporation at lower intensities and/or shorter durations, and demonstrate that surfactants can be used to manipulate the electroporation threshold of lipid bilayers.},

abstract = {We have used the nanometer scale alpha-Hemolysin pore to study the unzipping kinetics of individual DNA hairpins under constant force or constant loading rate. Using a dynamic voltage control method, the entry rate of polynucleotides into the pore and the voltage pattern applied to induce hairpin unzipping are independently set. Thus, hundreds of unzipping events can be tested in a short period of time (few minutes), independently of the unzipping voltage amplitude. Because our method does not entail the physical coupling of the molecules under test to a force transducer, very high throughput can be achieved. We used our method to study DNA unzipping kinetics at small forces, which have not been accessed before. We find that in this regime the static unzipping times decrease exponentially with voltage with a characteristic slope that is independent of the duplex region sequence, and that the intercept depends strongly on the duplex region energy. We also present the first nanopore dynamic force measurements (time varying force). Our results are in agreement with the approximately logV dependence at high V (where V is the loading rate) observed by other methods. The extension of these measurements to lower loading rates reveals a much weaker dependence on V.},

@article{Aksimentiev2010,
abstract = {Within just a decade from the pioneering work demonstrating the utility of nanopores for molecular sensing, nanopores have emerged as versatile systems for single-molecule manipulation and analysis. In a typical setup, a gradient of the electrostatic potential captures charged solutes from the solution and forces them to move through a single nanopore, across an otherwise impermeable membrane. The ionic current blockades resulting from the presence of a solute in a nanopore can reveal the type of the solute, for example, the nucleotide makeup of a DNA strand. Despite great success, the microscopic mechanisms underlying the functionality of such stochastic sensors remain largely unknown, as it is not currently possible to characterize the microscopic conformations of single biomolecules directly in a nanopore and thereby unequivocally establish the causal relationship between the observables and the microscopic events. Such a relationship can be determined using molecular dynamics-a computational method that can accurately predict the time evolution of a molecular system starting from a given microscopic state. This article describes recent applications of this method to the process of DNA transport through biological and synthetic nanopores.},

Apparent thermodynamic parameters were obtained by analyzing the correlation amplitude through a two-state model and are consistent with steady-state fluorescence measurements. The kinetics of closing the loop show non-Arrhenius behavior, in agreement with theoretical prediction and other experimental measurements on peptide folding. The fluctuation rates show a fractional power dependence (beta = 0.83) on the solution viscosity. A much slower intrachain diffusion coefficient in comparison to that of polypeptides was derived based on the first passage time theory of SSS [Szabo, A., Schulten, K. {\&} Schulten, Z. (1980) J.

abstract = {Outer membrane protein G is a monomeric $\beta$-barrel porin that has seven flexible loops on its extracellular side. Conformational changes of these labile loops induce gating spikes in current recordings that we exploited as the prime sensing element for protein detection. The gating characteristics, open probability, frequency, and current decrease, provide rich information for analyte identification. Here, we show that two antibiotin antibodies each induced a distinct gating pattern, which allowed them to be readily detected and simultaneously discriminated by a single OmpG nanopore in the presence of fetal bovine serum. Our results demonstrate the feasibility of directly profiling proteins in real-world samples with minimal or no sample pretreatment.},

abstract = {The alpha-beta tubulin heterodimer is the structural subunit of microtubules, which are cytoskeletal elements that are essential for intracellular transport and cell division in all eukaryotes. Each tubulin monomer binds a guanine nucleotide, which is non- exchangeable when it is bound in the alpha subunit, or N site, and exchangeable when bound in the beta subunit, or E site. The alpha- and beta-tubulins share 40{\%} amino-acid sequence identity, both exist in several isotype forms, and both undergo a variety of post- translational modifications1 been found with the proteins FtsZ2 , which are involved in cell division in bacteria and Drosophila, respectively. Here we present an atomic model of the alpha-beta tubulin dimer fitted to a 3.7-A ˚ density map obtained by electron crystallography of zinc- induced tubulin sheets. The structures of alpha- and beta-tubulin are basically identical: each monomer is formed by a core of two beta- sheets surrounded by alpha-helices. The monomer structure is very compact, but can be divided into three functional domains: the amino-terminal domain containing the nucleotide-binding region, an intermediate domain containing the Taxol-binding site, and the carboxy-terminal domain, which probably constitutes the binding surface for motor proteins.},

abstract = {An image processing system was programmed to automatically track and digitize the movement of amebae under phase-contrast microscopy. The amebae moved in a novel chemotaxis chamber designed to provide stable linear attractant gradients in a thin agarose gel. The gradients were established by pumping attractant and buffer solutions through semipermeable hollow fibers embedded in the agarose gel. Gradients were established within 30 min and shown to be stable for at least a further 90 min. By using this system it is possible to collect detailed data on the movement of large numbers of individual amebae in defined attractant gradients. We used the system to study motility and chemotaxis by a score of Dictyostelium discoideum wild-type and mutant strains, including "streamer" mutants which are generally regarded as being altered in chemotaxis. None of the mutants were altered in chemotaxis in the optimal cAMP gradient of 25 nM/mm, with a midpoint of 25 nM. The dependence of chemotaxis on cAMP concentration, gradient steepness, and temporal changes in the gradient were investigated. We also analyzed the relationship between turning behavior and the direction of travel during chemotaxis in stable gradients. The results suggest that during chemotaxis D. discoideum amebae spatially integrate information about local increases in cAMP concentration at various points on the cell surface.},

This is applied to simple geometric models of transmembrane ion channels to obtain an estimate of the magnitude of ion concentration fluctuation noise in the channel current. Pure polypeptide alamethicin forms stable ion channels with multiple conductance states in artificial phospholipid bilayers isolated onto tips of micropipettes with gigaohm seals. In the single-channel current recorded by voltage-clamp techniques, excess noise was found after the background instrumental noise and the intrinsic Johnson and shot noises were removed. The noise que to ion concentration fluctuations via diffusion was isolated by the dependence of the excess current noise on buffer ion concentration. The magnitude of the concentration fluctuation noise derived from experimental data lies within limits estimated using our simple geometric channel models. Variation of the noise magnitude for alamethicin channels in various conductance states agrees with theoretical prediction.},

abstract = {Bimolecular membranes are formed from two lipid monolayers at an air-water interface by the apposition of their hydrocarbon chains when an aperture in a Teflon partition separating two aqueous phases is lowered through the interface. Formation of the membrane is monitored by an increase of the electrical capacity, as measured with a voltage clamp. Electrical resistance of the unmodified membrane is analogous to that of conventional planar bilayers (black lipid membranes) prepared in the presence of a hydrocarbon solvent, i.e., 10(6)-10(8) ohm cm(2); the resistance can be lowered to values of 10(3) ohm cm(2) by gramicidin, an antibiotic that modifies the conductance only when the membranes are of biomolecular thickness. In contrast to the resistance, there is a significant difference between the capacity of bilayers made from mono-layers and that of hydrocarbon-containing bilayers made by phase transition; the average values are 0.9 and 0.45 muF cm(-2), respectively. The value of 0.9 muF cm(-2) approximates that of biological membranes. Assuming a dielectric constant of 2.1 for the hydrocarbon region, the dielectric thickness, as calculated from a capacity of 0.9 muF cm(-2), is 22 A. This value is 6-10 A smaller than the actual thickness of the hydrocarbon region of bilayers and cell membranes, as determined by x-ray diffraction. The difference may be due to a limited penetration of water into the hydrocarbon region near the ester groups that would lower the electrical resistance of this region and reduce the dielectric thickness. Asymmetric membranes have been formed by adjoining two lipid monolayers of different chemical composition.},

abstract = {Kinesin-1 is a motor protein that carries cellular cargo such as membrane-bounded organelles along microtubules (MTs). The homodimeric motor molecule contains two N-terminal motor domains (the motor "heads"), a long coiled-coil domain (the "rod" or "stalk"), and two small globular "tail" domains. Much has been learned about how kinesin's heads step along a MT and how the tail is involved in cargo binding and autoinhibition. However, little is known about the role of the rod. Here, we investigate the extension of the rod during active transport by measuring the height at which MTs glide over a kinesin-coated surface in the presence of ATP. To perform height measurements with nanometer precision, we used fluorescence interference contrast microscopy, which is based on the self-interference of fluorescent light from objects near a reflecting surface. Using an in situ calibrating method, we determined that kinesin-1 molecules elevate gliding MTs 17 +/- 2 nm (mean +/- SEM) above the surface. When varying the composition of the surrounding nucleotides or removing the negatively charged -COOH termini of the MTs by subtilisin digestion, we found no significant changes in the measured distance. Even though this distance is significantly shorter than the contour length of the motor molecule ( approximately 60 nm), it may be sufficient to prevent proteins bound to the MTs or prevent the organelles from interfering with transport.},

We describe the heterogeneous nanoscale distribution of lipid molecules within microscale membrane domains in multicomponent lipid bilayers composed of dipalmitoylphosphatidylcholine (DPPC), di- lauroylphosphatidylcholine (DLPC), and cholesterol (chol). The lipids were labeled with the fluorescent lipid analogues Bodipy-PC and DiI-C20:0 to identify the distribution of individual membrane components. We used a near-field scanning optical microscope (NSOM) at room temperature to identify the nanoscale structures in the membrane. Simultaneous multicolor NSOM imaging at the emission maxima of the fluorescent analogues revealed a patchy distribution of Bodipy-PC and DiI-C20:0 indicative of phase separations in the bilayer. In a cholesterol-free system (DPPC/DLPC ) 1:1), NSOM images proved that the two phosphatidylcholine molecules can coexist in domains at the micrometer level but form nanoscopic patches within the domains;DPPCoccurs at the edge of the domains, whereasDLPCis present throughout the domains. In the presence of cholesterol(DPPC/DLPC)7:3, chol)18.9{\%}), the two lipid molecules were more miscible but incomplete phase separations also occurred. The average domain sizes were 140-200 nm, well below the resolution capabilities of diffraction-limited light microscopy techniques; the domains wereunresolvablebyconfocal microscopy.Ourhigh-resolutionNSOMstudies ofmembranedomainbehavior provide a better understanding of complex membrane phase phenomena in multicomponent biological membranes.},

However, optical approaches are limited by the inability of visible light to penetrate deep into tissues. Here, we show an approach based on radio-frequency magnetic-field heating of nanoparticles to remotely activate temperature-sensitive cation channels in cells. Superparamagnetic ferrite nanoparticles were targeted to specific proteins on the plasma membrane of cells expressing TRPV1, and heated by a radio-frequency magnetic field. Using fluorophores as molecular thermometers, we show that the induced temperature increase is highly localized. Thermal activation of the channels triggers action potentials in cultured neurons without observable toxic effects. This approach can be adapted to stimulate other cell types and, moreover, may be used to remotely manipulate other cellular machinery for novel therapeutics.},

abstract = {The dynamics of single-stranded DNA in an alpha-Hemolysin protein pore was studied at the single-molecule level. The escape time for DNA molecules initially drawn into the pore was measured in the absence of an externally applied electric field. These measurements revealed two well-separated timescales, one of which is surprisingly long (on the order of milliseconds). We characterized the long timescale as being associated with the binding and unbinding of DNA from the pore. We have also found that a transmembrane potential as small as 20 mV strongly biased the escape of DNA from the pore. These experiments have been made possible due to the development of a feedback control system, allowing the rapid modulation of the applied force on individual DNA molecules while inside the pore.},

The main challenge of building microfabricated cargo loading stations is to adjust the sum of non-covalent interactions such that the station stably holds on to the cargo under static conditions, but allows for transfer when a gliding microtubule collides with station-bound cargo and starts to pull on it. Successful pick-up of cargo could be observed using biotin-anti-biotin interactions and hybridized oligonucleotides. The effect of different tethering chemistries on the efficiency of cargo pick-up was tested.},

abstract = {Microtubule organization is key to eukaryotic cell structure and function. In most animal cells, interphase microtubules organize around the centrosome, the major microtubule organizing centre (MTOC). Interphase microtubules can also become organized independently of a centrosome, but how acentrosomal microtubules arrays form and whether they are functionally equivalent to centrosomal arrays remains poorly understood. Here, we show that the interphase microtubule arrays of fission yeast cells can persist independently of nuclear-associated MTOCs, including the spindle pole body (SPB)--the centrosomal equivalent. By artificially enucleating cells, we show that arrays can form de novo (self-organize) without nuclear-associated MTOCs, but require the microtubule nucleator mod20-mbo1-mto1 (refs 3-5), the bundling factor ase1 (refs 6,7), and the kinesin klp2 (refs 8,9). Microtubule arrays in enucleated and nucleated cells are morphologically indistinguishable and similarly locate to the cellular axis and centre. By simultaneously tracking nuclear-independent and SPB-associated microtubule arrays within individual nucleated cells, we show that both define the cell centre with comparable precision. We propose that in fission yeast, nuclear-independent, self-organized, acentrosomal microtubule arrays are structurally and functionally equivalent to centrosomal arrays.},

abstract = {Kinesin and cytoplasmic dynein are microtubule-based motor proteins that actively transport material throughout the cell. Microtubules can intersect at a variety of angles both near the nucleus and at the cell periphery, and the behavior of molecular motors at these intersections has implications for long-range transport efficiency and accuracy. To test motor function at microtubule intersections, crossovers were arranged in vitro using flow to orient successive layers of filaments. Single kinesin and cytoplasmic dynein-dynactin molecules fused with green-fluorescent protein, and artificial bead cargos decorated with multiple motors, were observed while they encountered intersections. Single kinesins tend to cross intersecting microtubules, whereas single dynein-dynactins have a more varied response. For bead cargos, kinesin motion is independent of motor number. Dynein beads with high motor numbers pause, but their actions become more varied as the motor number decreases. These results suggest that regulating the number of active dynein molecules could change a motile cargo into one that is anchored at an intersection, consistent with dynein's proposed transport and tethering functions in the cell.},

abstract = {The unwinding of nucleic acid secondary structures within cells is crucial to maintain genomic integrity and prevent abortive transcription and translation initiation. DHX36, also known as RHAU or G4R1, is a DEAH-box ATP-dependent helicase highly specific for DNA and RNA G-quadruplexes (G4s). A fundamental mechanistic understanding of the interaction between helicases and their G4 substrates is important to elucidate G4 biology and pave the way toward G4-targeted therapies. Here we analyze how the thermodynamic stability of G4 substrates affects binding and unwinding by DHX36. We modulated the stability of the G4 substrates by varying the sequence and the number of G-tetrads and by using small, G4-stabilizing molecules. We found an inverse correlation between the thermodynamic stability of the G4 substrates and rates of unwinding by DHX36. In stark contrast, the ATPase activity of the helicase was largely independent of substrate stability pointing toward a decoupling mechanism akin to what has been observed for many double-stranded DEAD-box RNA helicases. Our study provides the first evidence that DHX36 uses a local, non-processive mechanism to unwind G4 substrates, reminiscent of that of eukaryotic initiation factor 4A (eIF4A) on double-stranded substrates.},

The stability of mercaptoundecanoic acid-capped Au nanoparticles is studied at a set pH using the hydroxide as base and different cations of various sizes. The counterions used are sodium (Na(+)), tetramethylammonium (TMA(+)), tetraethylammonium (TEA(+)), and tetrabutylammonium (TBA(+)). The particles precipitate in the 70-90 mM range with Na(+) as the counterion, but with quaternary ammonium hydroxides the particles are stable even in concentrations exceeding 1 M. The change in solubility is linked to a strongly adsorbed layer on the surface of the ligand shell of the nanoparticles. The increased concentration range obtained with TEAOH is further used to facilitate thiol exchange which occurs at a greater extent than would be achieved in NaOH solution.},

This amendment and extension is necessary in lieu of recent experiments in which enzymes are shown to perform pump, motor, and locomotion functions resembling their macroscopic counterparts. Classical textbook depicts enzyme, or an MME, as biocatalyst which can enhance the rate of a chemical reaction by lowering the activation barrier but cannot shift the thermodynamic equilibrium of the biochemical reaction. An energy transducer, on the other hand, must also be able to harvest, store, or divert energy and in doing so alter the chemical equilibrium, change the energy form, fuel an energy consuming process, or perform all these functions stepwise in one catalytic turnover. The catalytic wheel presented in this communication is both a catalyst and an energy transducer and can perform all these tasks with ease. A Conformational Coupling Model for the rotary motors and a Barrier Surfing Model for the track-guided stepping motors and transporters, are presented and compared. It is shown that the core engine of the catalytic wheel, or a Brownian motor, is a Markovian engine. It remains to be seen if this core engine is the basic mechanism for a wide variety of bio-molecular energy transducers, as well as certain other dynamic systems, for example, the Parrondo's Games. ?? 2004 Elsevier B.V.

The pin contains a conserved phenylalanine that mediates a transient base-stacking interaction that is absolutely required for separation of dsDNA. The pin is secured at its tip by protein-protein interactions through an extended SH3 domain thereby creating a rigid strut. The conserved interface between the pin and the SH3 domain provides the mechanism for tight coupling of translocation to strand separation. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {Helicases are molecular motor enzymes that unwind and translocate nucleic acids. One of the central questions regarding helicase activity is whether the process of coupling ATP hydrolysis to DNA unwinding requires an oligomeric form of the enzyme. We have applied a pre-steady-state kinetics approach to address this question with the bacteriophage T4 Dda helicase. If a helicase can function as a monomer, then the burst amplitude in the pre-steady state might be similar to the concentration of enzyme, whereas if the helicase required oligomerization, then the amplitude would be significantly less than the enzyme concentration. DNA unwinding of an oligonucleotide substrate was conducted by using a Kintek rapid quench-flow instrument. The substrate consisted of 12 bp adjacent to 12 nucleotides of single-stranded DNA. Dda (4 nM) was incubated with substrate (16 nM) in buffer, and the unwinding reaction was initiated by the addition of ATP (5 mM) and Mg(2+) (10 mM). The reaction was stopped by the addition of 400 mM EDTA. Product formation exhibited biphasic kinetics, and the data were fit to the equation for a single exponential followed by a steady state. The amplitude of the first phase was 3.5 +/- 0.2 nM, consistent with a monomeric helicase. The burst amplitude of product formation was measured over a range of enzyme and substrate concentrations and remained consistent with a functional monomer. Thus, Dda can rapidly unwind oligonucleotide substrates as a monomer, indicating that the functional molecular motor component of a helicase can reside within a single polypeptide.},

abstract = {DNA intercalators are widely used as fluorescent probes to visualize DNA and DNA transactions in vivo and in vitro. It is well known that they perturb DNA structure and stability, which can in turn influence DNA-processing by proteins. Here we elucidate this perturbation by combining single-dye fluorescence microscopy with force spectroscopy and measuring the kinetics of DNA intercalation by the mono- and bis-intercalating cyanine dyes SYTOX Orange, SYTOX Green, SYBR Gold, YO-PRO-1, YOYO-1 and POPO-3. We show that their DNA-binding affinity is mainly governed by a strongly tension-dependent dissociation rate. These rates can be tuned over a range of seven orders of magnitude by changing DNA tension, intercalating species and ionic strength. We show that optimizing these rates minimizes the impact of intercalators on strand separation and enzymatic activity. These new insights provide handles for the improved use of intercalators as DNA probes with minimal perturbation and maximal efficacy.},

abstract = {A continuous fluorescence-based assay is described for measuring helicase-mediated unwinding of duplex DNA. The assay utilizes an oligonucleotide substrate containing the fluorescent adenine analog, 2-aminopurine, at regular intervals. 2-Aminopurine forms a Watson-Crick-type base pair with thymine and does not distort normal B-form DNA. Fluorescence of the 2-aminopurines within this oligonucleotide is quenched 2-fold upon its hybridization to a complementary strand. Unwinding of this substrate by the T4 dda helicase restores the fluorescence of the 2-aminopurines and is easily followed using stopped-flow or steady-state fluorescence spectroscopy. The flourescence-based assay provides rate data comparable to that obtained from conventional discontinuous assays using labeled substrates and additionally furnishes a means for following a single turnover. This assay should prove useful for defining the mechanism by which helicases unwind duplex DNA.},

This permits high degrees of chemical and dimensional control. High aspect-ratio nanorods have a large surface area for functionalization. By varying the metal segments in the nanorods, spatial control over the binding of functional biomolecules that correspond with the unique surface chemistry of the metal segment can be achieved.

abstract = {Many cellular systems rely on the ability to interpret spatial heterogeneities in chemoattractant concentration to direct cell migration. The accuracy of this process is limited by stochastic fluctuations in the concentration of the external signal and in the internal signaling components. Here we use information theory to determine the optimal scheme to detect the location of an external chemoattractant source in the presence of noise. We compute the minimum amount of mutual information needed between the chemoattractant gradient and the internal signal to achieve a prespecified chemotactic accuracy. We show that more accurate chemotaxis requires greater mutual information. We also demonstrate that a priori information can improve chemotaxis efficiency. We compare the optimal signaling schemes with existing experimental measurements and models of eukaryotic gradient sensing. Remarkably, there is good quantitative agreement between the optimal response when no a priori assumption is made about the location of the existing source, and the observed experimental response of unpolarized Dictyostelium discoideum cells. In contrast, the measured response of polarized D. discoideum cells matches closely the optimal scheme, assuming prior knowledge of the external gradient-for example, through prolonged chemotaxis in a given direction. Our results demonstrate that different observed classes of responses in cells (polarized and unpolarized) are optimal under varying information assumptions.},

abstract = {In microtubule (MT) translocation assays, using colloidal gold particles coupled to monoclonal tubulin antibodies to mark positions along MTs, we found that relative motion is possible between the gold particle and an MT, gliding on dynein or kinesin. Such motion evidently occurred by an affinity release and rebinding mechanism that did not require motor activity on the particle. As the MTs moved, particles drifted to the trailing edge of the MT and then were released. Sometimes the particles transferred from one MT to another, moving orthogonally. Although motion of the particles was uniformly rearward, movement was toward the (-) or (+) end of the MT, depending on whether dynein or kinesin, respectively, was used in the assay. These results open possibilities for physiological mechanisms of organelle and other movement that, although dependent on motor-driven microtubule transport, do not require direct motor attachment between the organelle and the microtubule. Our observations on the direction of particle drift and time of release may also provide confirmation in a dynamic system for the conclusion that beta tubulin is exposed at the (+) end of the MT.},

abstract = {MspA is the major porin of Mycobacterium smegmatis mediating the exchange of hydrophilic solutes across the outer membrane (OM). It is the prototype of a new family of octameric porins with a single central channel of 9.6 nm in length and consists of two hydrophobic beta-barrels of 3.7 nm in length and a more hydrophilic, globular rim domain. The length of the hydrophobic domain of MspA does not match the thicknesses of mycobacterial OMs of 5-12 nm as derived from electron micrographs. Further, the membrane topology of MspA is unknown as it is for any other mycobacterial OM protein. We used MspA as a molecular ruler to define the boundaries of the OM of M. smegmatis by surface labeling of single cysteine mutants. Seventeen mutants covered the surface of the rim domain and were biotinylated with a membrane-impermeable reagent. The label efficiencies in vitro were remarkably similar to the predicted accessibilities of the cysteines. By contrast, six of these mutants were protected from biotinylation in M. smegmatis cells. Tryptophan 21 defines a horizontal plane that dissects the surface-exposed versus the membrane-protected residues of MspA. The 8 phenylalanines at position 99 form a ring at the periplasmic end of the hydrophobic beta-barrel domain. These results indicated that (i) the membrane boundaries of MspA are defined by aromatic girdles as in porins of Gram-negative bacteria and (ii) loops and a 3.4-nm long part of the hydrophilic rim domain are embedded into the OM of M. smegmatis. This is the first report suggesting that elements other than hydrophobic alpha-helices or beta-sheets are integrated into a lipid membrane.},

The 2B domain adopts an SH3 fold which, although common in eukaryotes, is extremely rare in bacterial systems. In addition, the D. radiodurans RecD2 structure has aided us in deciphering lower resolution (3.6 A) electron density maps for the E. coli RecBCD enzyme in complex with a long DNA substrate that interacts with the RecD subunit. Taken together, these structures indicated an important role for the 1B domain of RecD, a beta-hairpin that extends from the surface of the 1A domain and interacts with the DNA substrate. On the basis of these structural data, we designed a mutant RecD2 helicase that lacks this pin. The 'pin-less' mutant protein is a fully active ssDNA-dependent ATPase but totally lacks helicase activity.},

abstract = {Mechanisms underlying the organization of centrosome-derived microtubule arrays are well understood, but less is known about how acentrosomal microtubule networks are formed. The basal cortex of polarized epithelial cells contains a microtubule network of mixed polarity. We examined how this network is organized by imaging microtubule dynamics in acentrosomal basal cytoplasts derived from these cells. We show that the steady-state microtubule network appears to form by a combination of microtubule-microtubule and microtubule-cortex interactions, both of which increase microtubule stability. We used computational modeling to determine whether these microtubule parameters are sufficient to generate a steady-state acentrosomal microtubule network. Microtubules undergoing dynamic instability without any stabilization points continuously remodel their organization without reaching a steady-state network. However, the addition of increased microtubule stabilization at microtubule-microtubule and microtubule-cortex interactions results in the rapid assembly of a steady-state microtubule network in silico that is remarkably similar to networks formed in situ. These results define minimal parameters for the self-organization of an acentrosomal microtubule network.},

abstract = {We show that an electric field can drive single-stranded RNA and DNA molecules through a 2.6-nm diameter ion channel in a lipid bilayer membrane. Because the channel diameter can accommodate only a single strand of RNA or DNA, each polymer traverses the membrane as an extended chain that partially blocks the channel. The passage of each molecule is detected as a transient decrease of ionic current whose duration is proportional to polymer length. Channel blockades can therefore be used to measure polynucleotide length. With further improvements, the method could in principle provide direct, high-speed detection of the sequence of bases in single molecules of DNA or RNA.},

abstract = {The free solution mobility of DNA molecules of different molecular weights, the sequence dependence of the mobility, and the diffusion coefficients of small single- and double-stranded DNA (ss- and dsDNA) molecules can be measured accurately by capillary zone electrophoresis, using coated capillaries to minimize the electroosmotic flow (EOF) of the solvent. Very small differences in mobility between various analytes can be quantified if a mobility marker is used to correct for small differences in EOF between successive experiments. Using mobility markers, the molecular weight at which the free solution mobility of dsDNA becomes independent of molecular weight is found to be approximately 170 bp in 40 mM Tris-acetate-EDTA buffer. A DNA fragment containing 170 bp has a contour length of approximately 58 nm, close to the persistence length of DNA under these buffer conditions. Hence, the approach of the free solution mobility of DNA to a plateau value may be associated with the transition from a rod-like to a coil-like conformation in solution. Markers have also been used to determine that the free solution mobilities of ss- and dsDNA oligomers are sequence-dependent. Double-stranded 20-bp oligomers containing runs of three or more adenine residues in a row (A-tracts) migrate somewhat more slowly than 20-mers without A-tracts, suggesting that somewhat larger numbers of counterions are condensed in the ion atmospheres of A-tract DNAs, decreasing their net effective charge. Single-stranded 20-mers with symmetric sequences migrate approximately 1{\%} faster than their double-stranded counterparts, and faster than single-stranded 20-mers containing A(5)- or T(5)-tracts. Interestingly, the average mobility of two complementary single-stranded 20-mers is equal to the mobility of the double-stranded oligomer formed upon annealing. Finally, the stopped migration method has been used to measure the diffusion coefficients of single- and double-stranded oligomers. The diffusion coefficients of ssDNA oligomers containing 20 nucleotides are approximately 50{\%} larger than those of double-stranded DNA oligomers of the same size, reflecting the greater flexibility of ssDNA molecules. The methods used to carry out these experiments are also described in detail.},

abstract = {Binding of ligand to its receptor is a stochastic process that exhibits fluctuations in time and space. In chemotaxis, this leads to a noisy input signal. Therefore, in a gradient of chemoattractant, the cell may occasionally experience a "wrong" gradient of occupied receptors. We obtained a simple equation for P(pos), the probability that half of the cell closest to the source of chemoattractant has higher receptor occupancy than the opposite half of the cell. P(pos) depends on four factors, the gradient property delC/sq. root of C, the receptor characteristic R(t)/K(D), a time-averaging constant I, and nonreceptor noise sigma(B). We measured chemotaxis of Dictyostelium cells to known shallow gradients of cAMP and obtained direct estimates for these constants. Furthermore, we observed that in shallow gradients, the measured chemotaxis index is correlated with P(pos), which suggests that chemotaxis in shallow gradients is a pure biased random walk. From the observed chemotaxis and derived time-averaging constant, we deduce that the gradient transducing second messenger has a lifetime of 2-8 s and a diffusion rate constant of approximately 1 microm(2)/s. Potential candidates for such second messengers are discussed.},

abstract = {A label- and immobilization-free approach to detecting the reversible formation of complexes between nucleic acids and proteins at the single-molecule level is described. The voltage-driven translocation of individual oligoribonucleotides through a nanoscale protein pore is observed by single-channel current recordings. The oligoribonucleotide 5'-C25A(25)-3' gives rise to current blockades with an average duration of approximately 0.5 ms. In the presence of the RNA-binding ATPase P4, a viral packaging motor from bacteriophage phi8, longer events of tens to hundreds of milliseconds are observed. Upon addition of ATP the long events disappear, indicating the dissociation of the P4RNA complex. The frequency of events also depends on the concentration of P4 and the length of the oligoribonucleotide, thereby confirming the specificity of the P4RNA events. This study shows that single-channel current recordings can be used to monitor RNA-protein complex formation, thus opening up a new means to examine the motor activity of RNA- or DNA-processing enzymes.},

abstract = {Radiative transfer of energy at the nanometre length scale is of great importance to a variety of technologies including heat-assisted magnetic recording, near-field thermophotovoltaics and lithography. Although experimental advances have enabled elucidation of near-field radiative heat transfer in gaps as small as 20-30 nanometres, quantitative analysis in the extreme near field (less than 10 nanometres) has been greatly limited by experimental challenges. Moreover, the results of pioneering measurements differed from theoretical predictions by orders of magnitude. Here we use custom-fabricated scanning probes with embedded thermocouples, in conjunction with new microdevices capable of periodic temperature modulation, to measure radiative heat transfer down to gaps as small as two nanometres. For our experiments we deposited suitably chosen metal or dielectric layers on the scanning probes and microdevices, enabling direct study of extreme near-field radiation between silica-silica, silicon nitride-silicon nitride and gold-gold surfaces to reveal marked, gap-size-dependent enhancements of radiative heat transfer. Furthermore, our state-of-the-art calculations of radiative heat transfer, performed within the theoretical framework of fluctuational electrodynamics, are in excellent agreement with our experimental results, providing unambiguous evidence that confirms the validity of this theory for modelling radiative heat transfer in gaps as small as a few nanometres. This work lays the foundations required for the rational design of novel technologies that leverage nanoscale radiative heat transfer.},

abstract = {A molecular machine is either a single macromolecule or a macromolecular complex. In spite of the striking superficial similarities between these natural nanomachines and their man-made macroscopic counterparts, there are crucial differences. Molecular machines in a living cell operate stochastically in an isothermal environment far from thermodynamic equilibrium. In this mini-review we present a catalog of the molecular machines and an inventory of the essential toolbox for theoretically modeling these machines. The tool kits include 1), nonequilibrium statistical-physics techniques for modeling machines and machine-driven processes; and 2), statistical-inference methods for reverse engineering a functional machine from the empirical data. The cell is often likened to a microfactory in which the machineries are organized in modular fashion; each module consists of strongly coupled multiple machines, but different modules interact weakly with each other. This microfactory has its own automated supply chain and delivery system. Buoyed by the success achieved in modeling individual molecular machines, we advocate integration of these models in the near future to develop models of functional modules. A system-level description of the cell from the perspective of molecular machinery (the mechanome) is likely to emerge from further integrations that we envisage here. ?? 2013 Biophysical Society.},

In this paper, nanotopography is examined as a means to guide differentiation, and its application is described in the context of different subsets of stem cells, with a particular focus on skeletal (mesenchymal) stem cells. To address the mechanistic basis underlying the topographical effects on stem cells, the likely contributions of indirect (biochemical signal-mediated) and direct (force-mediated) mechanotransduction are discussed. Data from proteomic research is also outlined in relation to topography-mediated fate determination, as this approach provides insight into the global molecular changes at the level of the functional effectors.},

MD simulations elucidate the microscopic origin of this effect: Li(+) and Na(+) bind DNA stronger than K(+).

NS3 is an important model system for understanding unwinding activities of DExH/D proteins, and it has been the subject of extensive structural and mutational analyses. Despite intense interest in NS3, the molecular and kinetic mechanisms for RNA unwinding by this helicase have remained obscure. We have developed a combinatorial, time-resolved approach for monitoring the microscopic behaviour of a helicase at each nucleotide of a duplex substrate. By applying this analysis to NS3, we have independently established the 'physical' and 'kinetic' step size for unwinding of RNA (18 base pairs, in each case), which we relate to the stoichiometry of the functional, translocating species. Having obtained microscopic unwinding rate constants at each position along the duplex, we demonstrate that NS3 unwinds RNA through a highly coordinated cycle of fast ripping and local pausing that occurs with regular spacing along the duplex substrate, much like the stepping behaviour of cytoskeletal motor proteins.},

OmpG is decorated with seven flexible loops that move dynamically to create a distinct gating pattern when ionic current passes through the pore. Biotin was chemically tethered to the most flexible one of these loops. The gating characteristic of the loop's movement in and out of the porin was substantially altered by analyte protein binding. The gating characteristics of the pore with bound targets were remarkably sensitive to molecular identity, even providing the ability to distinguish between homologues within an antibody mixture. A total of five gating parameters were analyzed for each analyte to create a unique fingerprint for each biotin-binding protein.

abstract = {Kinesin is a processive motor that takes 8.3-nm center-of-mass steps along microtubules for each adenosine triphosphate hydrolyzed. Whether kinesin moves by a "hand-over-hand" or an "inchworm" model has been controversial. We have labeled a single head of the kinesin dimer with a Cy3 fluorophore and localized the position of the dye to within 2 nm before and after a step. We observed that single kinesin heads take steps of 17.3 +/- 3.3 nm. A kinetic analysis of the dwell times between steps shows that the 17-nm steps alternate with 0-nm steps. These results strongly support a hand-over-hand mechanism, and not an inchworm mechanism. In addition, our results suggest that kinesin is bound by both heads to the microtubule while it waits for adenosine triphosphate in between steps.},

The mechanism of the bacteriophage T4 Dda helicase was investigated by preparing a DNA-PNA chimeric substrate. Surprisingly, Dda was able to unwind a substrate containing 12 PNA moieties in the loading strand of the enzyme. We suggest a mechanism whereby the Dda helicase contains two distinct DNA binding domains which allow an inchworm mechanism for translocation. A single step of the enzyme is sufficient to unwind the DNA-PNA chimera because several base pairs melt spontaneously due to thermal fraying. Hence, Dda helicase can unwind the substrate without actually translocating along the PNA. {\textcopyright} 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {The application of Raman spectroscopy to characterize natively unfolded proteins has been underdeveloped, even though it has significant technical advantages. We propose that a simple three-component band fitting of the amide I region can assist in the conformational characterization of the ensemble of structures present in natively unfolded proteins. The Raman spectra of alpha-synuclein, a prototypical natively unfolded protein, were obtained in the presence and absence of methanol, sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS), and hexafluoro-2-propanol (HFIP). Consistent with previous CD studies, the secondary structure becomes largely alpha-helical in HFIP and SDS and predominantly beta-sheet in 25{\%} methanol in water. In SDS, an increase in alpha-helical conformation is indicated by the predominant Raman amide I marker band at 1654 cm(-1) and the typical double minimum in the CD spectrum. In 25{\%} HFIP the amide I Raman marker band appears at 1653 cm(-1) with a peak width at half-height of approximately 33 cm(-1), and in 25{\%} methanol the amide I Raman band shifts to 1667 cm(-1) with a peak width at half-height of approximately 26 cm(-1). These well-characterized structural states provide the unequivocal assignment of amide I marker bands in the Raman spectrum of alpha-synuclein and by extrapolation to other natively unfolded proteins. The Raman spectrum of monomeric alpha-synuclein in aqueous solution suggests that the peptide bonds are distributed in both the alpha-helical and extended beta-regions of Ramachandran space. A higher frequency feature of the alpha-synuclein Raman amide I band resembles the Raman amide I band of ionized polyglutamate and polylysine, peptides which adopt a polyproline II helical conformation. Thus, a three-component band fitting is used to characterize the Raman amide I band of alpha-synuclein, phosvitin, alpha-casein, beta-casein, and the non-A beta component (NAC) of Alzheimer's plaque. These analyses demonstrate the ability of Raman spectroscopy to characterize the ensemble of secondary structures present in natively unfolded proteins.},

This environment influences DNA replication by increasing the concentration of the constituents, desolvation, decreasing the degrees of freedom for diffusion and hopping of proteins onto DNA, and enhancing binding equilibria and catalysis. However, the effect of macromolecular crowding on protein structure is poorly understood. Here we examine macromolecular crowding using the replication system of bacteriophage T7 and we show that it affects several aspects of DNA replication; the activity of DNA helicase increases and the sensitivity of DNA polymerase to salt is reduced. We also demonstrate, using small-angle X-ray scattering analysis, that the complex between DNA helicase and DNA polymerase/trx is far more compact in a crowded environment. The highest enzymatic activity corresponds to the most compact structure. Better knowledge of the effect of crowding on structure and activity will enhance mechanistic insight beyond information obtained from NMR and X-ray structures.},

abstract = {Mycobacteria have a unique outer membrane (OM) that is thicker than any other known biological membrane. Nutrients cross this permeability barrier by diffusion through porins. MspA is the major porin of Mycobacterium smegmatis. In this study we showed that three paralogues of MspA, namely MspB, MspC and MspD are also porins. However, only the mspA and mspC genes were expressed in the wild-type strain. None of the single deletion mutants displayed a significant OM permeability defect except for the mspA mutant. Deletion of the mspA gene caused activation of transcription of mspB and/or mspD in three independent strains by unknown chromosomal mutations. It is concluded that mspB and mspD provide backup porins for M. smegmatis. This also indicated that a minimal porin-mediated OM permeability is essential for survival of M. smegmatis. Electron microscopy in combination with quantitative image analysis of protein gels revealed that the number of pores per cell dropped from 2400 to 800 and 150 for the DeltamspA and DeltamspA DeltamspC mutant (ML10) respectively. The very low number of pores correlated well with the at least 20-fold lower channel activity of detergent extracts of the ML10 strain and its 15- and 75-fold lower permeability to nutrient molecules such as serine and glucose respectively. The amount of Msp porin and the OM permeability of the triple porin mutant lacking mspA, mspC and mspD was not altered. The growth rate of M. smegmatis dropped drastically with its porin-mediated OM permeability in contrast to porin mutants of Escherichia coli. These results show that porin-mediated influx of nutrients is a major determinant of the growth rate of M. smegmatis.},

abstract = {Most experiments on nanopores have concentrated on the pore-forming protein $\alpha$-haemolysin ($\alpha$HL) and on artificial pores in solid-state membranes. While biological pores offer an atomically precise structure and the potential for genetic engineering, solid-state nanopores offer durability, size and shape control, and are also better suited for integration into wafer-scale devices. However, each system has significant limitations: $\alpha$HL is difficult to integrate because it relies on delicate lipid bilayers for mechanical support, and the fabrication of solid-state nanopores with precise dimensions remains challenging. Here we show that these limitations may be overcome by inserting a single $\alpha$HL pore into a solid-state nanopore. A double-stranded DNA attached to the protein pore is threaded into a solid-state nanopore by electrophoretic translocation. Protein insertion is observed in 30-40{\%} of our attempts, and translocation of single-stranded DNA demonstrates that the hybrid nanopore remains functional. The hybrid structure offers a platform to create wafer-scale device arrays for genomic analysis, including sequencing.},

abstract = {The interactions of monomeric and dimeric kinesin and ncd constructs with microtubules have been investigated using cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) and several biochemical methods. There is a good consensus on the structure of dimeric ncd when bound to a tubulin dimer showing one head attached directly to tubulin, and the second head tethered to the first. However, the 3D maps of dimeric kinesin motor domains are still quite controversial and leave room for different interpretations. Here we reinvestigated the microtubule binding patterns of dimeric kinesins by cryo-EM and digital 3D reconstruction under different nucleotide conditions and different motor:tubulin ratios, and determined the molecular mass of motor-tubulin complexes by STEM. Both methods revealed complementary results. We found that the ratio of bound kinesin motor-heads to alphabeta-tubulin dimers was never reaching above 1.5 irrespective of the initial mixing ratios. It appears that each kinesin dimer occupies two microtubule-binding sites, provided that there is a free one nearby. Thus the appearances of different image reconstructions can be explained by non-specific excess binding of motor heads. Consequently, the use of different apparent density distributions for docking the X-ray structures onto the microtubule surface leads to different and mutually exclusive models. We propose that in conditions of stoichiometric binding the two heads of a kinesin dimer separate and bind to different tubulin subunits. This is in contrast to ncd where the two heads remain tightly attached on the microtubule surface. Using dimeric kinesin molecules crosslinked in their neck domain we also found that they stabilize protofilaments axially, but not laterally, which is a strong indication that the two heads of the dimers bind along one protofilament, rather than laterally bridging two protofilaments. A molecular walking model based on these results summarizes our conclusions and illustrates the implications of symmetry for such models.},

abstract = {The stepping behavior of single kinesin-1 motor proteins has been studied in great detail. However, in cells, these motors often do not work alone but rather function in small groups when they transport cellular cargo. Until now, the cooperative interactions between motors in such groups were poorly understood. A fundamental question is whether two or more motors that move the same cargo step in synchrony, producing the same step size as a single motor, or whether the step size of the cargo movement varies. To answer this question, we performed in vitro gliding motility assays, where microtubules coated with quantum dots were driven over a glass surface by a known number of kinesin-1 motors. The motion of individual microtubules was then tracked with nanometer precision. In the case of transport by two kinesin-1 motors, we found successive 4-nm steps, corresponding to half the step size of a single motor. Dwell-time analysis did not reveal any coordination, in the sense of alternate stepping, between the motors. When three motors interacted in collective transport, we identified distinct forward and backward jumps on the order of 10 nm. The existence of the fractional steps as well as the distinct jumps illustrate a lack of synchronization and has implications for the analysis of motor-driven organelle movement investigated in vivo.},

Subsequently we discuss the conductance blockade $\Delta$G due to the insertion of a DNA molecule into the pore, which we study experimentally as a function of pore diameter. We find that $\Delta$G decreases with pore diameter, contrary to the predictions of earlier models that forecasted a constant $\Delta$G. We compare three models for $\Delta$G, all of which provide good agreement with our experimental data.},

abstract = {We measured the elastic properties and intrinsic breaking strength of free-standing monolayer graphene membranes by nanoindentation in an atomic force microscope. The force-displacement behavior is interpreted within a framework of nonlinear elastic stress-strain response, and yields second- and third-order elastic stiffnesses of 340 newtons per meter (N m(-1)) and -690 Nm(-1), respectively. The breaking strength is 42 N m(-1) and represents the intrinsic strength of a defect-free sheet. These quantities correspond to a Young's modulus of E = 1.0 terapascals, third-order elastic stiffness of D = -2.0 terapascals, and intrinsic strength of sigma(int) = 130 gigapascals for bulk graphite. These experiments establish graphene as the strongest material ever measured, and show that atomically perfect nanoscale materials can be mechanically tested to deformations well beyond the linear regime.},

abstract = {Many eukaryotic cells, including Dictyostelium discoideum amoebae, fibroblasts, and neutrophils, are able to respond to chemoattractant gradients with high sensitivity. Recent studies have demonstrated that, after the introduction of a chemoattractant gradient, several chemotaxis pathway components exhibit a subcellular reorganization that cannot be described as a simple amplification of the external gradient. Instead, this reorganization has the characteristics of a switch, leading to a well defined front and back. Here, we propose a directional sensing mechanism in which two second messengers are produced at equal rates. The diffusion of one of them, coupled with an inactivation scheme, ensures a switch-like response to external gradients for a large range of gradient steepness and average concentration. Furthermore, our model is able to reverse the subcellular organization rapidly, and its response to multiple simultaneous chemoattractant sources is in good agreement with recent experimental results. Finally, we propose that the dynamics of a heterotrimeric G protein might allow for a specific biochemical realization of our model.},

abstract = {Electric pulses of intensity in kilovolts per centimeter and of duration in microseconds to milliseconds cause a temporary loss of the semipermeability of cell membranes, thus leading to ion leakage, escape of metabolites, and increased uptake by cells of drugs, molecular probes, and DNA. A generally accepted term describing this phenomenon is "electroporation." Other effects of a high-intensity electric field on cell membranes include membrane fusions, bleb formation, cell lysis... etc. Electroporation and its related phenomena reflect the basic bioelectrochemistry of cell membranes and are thus important for the study of membrane structure and function. These phenomena also occur in such events as electric injury, electrocution, and cardiac procedures involving electric shocks. Electroporation has found applications in: (a) introduction of plasmids or foreign DNA into living cells for gene transfections, (b) fusion of cells to prepare heterokaryons, hybridoma, hybrid embryos... etc., (c) insertion of proteins into cell membranes, (d) improving drug delivery and hence effectiveness in chemotherapy of cancerous cells, (e) constructing animal model by fusing human cells with animal tissues, (f) activation of membrane transporters and enzymes, and (g) alteration of genetic expression in living cells. A brief review of mechanistic studies of electroporation is given.},

abstract = {Electroporation is widely used to achieve gene transfection. A common problem in electroporation is that it has a lower viability than any other transfection method. In this study, we developed a novel electroporation device using a capillary tip and a pipette that was effective on a wide range of mammalian cells, including cell lines, primary cells, and stem cells. The capillary electroporation system considerably reduced cell death during electroporation because of its wire-type electrode, which has a small surface area. The experimental results also indicated that the cell viability was dependent on the change in pH induced by electrolysis during electroporation. Additionally, the use of a long and narrow capillary tube combined with simple pipetting shortened the overall time of the electroporation process by up to 15 min, even under different conditions with 24 samples. These results were supported by comparison with a conventional electroporation system. The transfection rate and the cell viability were enhanced by the use of the capillary system, which had a high transfection rate of more than 80{\%} in general cell lines such as HeLa and COS-7, and more than 50{\%} in hard-to-transfect cells such as stem or primary cells. The viability was approximately 70-80{\%} in all cell types used in this study.},

abstract = {A two-dimensional stochastic model for the dynamics of microtubules in gliding-assay experiments is presented here, which includes the viscous drag acting on the moving fiber and the interaction with the kinesins. For this purpose, we model kinesin as a spring, and explicitly use parameter values to characterize the model from experimental data. We numerically compute the mean attachment lifetimes of all motors, the total force exerted on the microtubules at all times, the effects of a distribution in the motor speeds, and also the mean velocity of a microtubule in a gliding assay. We find quantitative agreement with the results of J. Howard, A. J. Hudspeth, and R. D. Vale, Nature. 342:154-158. We perform additional numerical analysis of the individual motors, and show how cancellation of the forces exerted by the many motors creates a resultant longitudinal force much smaller than the maximum force that could be exerted by a single motor. We also examine the effects of inhomogeneities in the motor-speeds. Finally, we present a simple theoretical model for microtubules dynamics in gliding assays. We show that the model can be analytically solved in the limit of few motors attached to the microtubule and in the opposite limit of high motor density. We find that the speed of the microtubule goes like the mean speed of the motors in good quantitative agreement with the experimental and numerical results.},

abstract = {RecBCD is a processive, DNA-based motor enzyme with both helicase and nuclease activities. We used high-resolution optical trapping to study individual RecBCD molecules moving against applied forces up to 8 pN. Fine-scale motion was smooth down to a detection limit of 2 nm, implying a unitary step size below six basepairs (bp). Episodes of constant-velocity motion over hundreds to thousands of basepairs were punctuated by abrupt switches to a different speed or by spontaneous pauses of mean length 3 s. RecBCD occasionally reversed direction, sliding backward along DNA. Backsliding could be halted by reducing the force, after which forward motion sometimes resumed, often after a delay. Elasticity measurements showed that the DNA substrate was partially denatured during backsliding events, but reannealed concomitant with the resumption of forward movement. Our observations show that RecBCD-DNA complexes can exist in multiple, functionally distinct states that persist for many catalytic turnovers: such states may help tune enzyme activity for various biological functions.},

The principal challenge in designing smart dust biosensors is integrating transport functions with energy supply into the device. Here, we report a hybrid microdevice that is powered by ATP and relies on antibody-functionalized microtubules and kinesin motors to transport the target analyte into a detection region. The transport step replaces the wash step in traditional double-antibody sandwich assays. Owing to their small size and autonomous function, we envision that large numbers of such smart dust biosensors could be inserted into organisms or distributed into the environment for remote sensing.},

We show that the observed spread in this distribution is caused by viscous-drag-induced velocity fluctuations that are correlated with the initial conformation of nanopore-captured molecules. This contribution exceeds that due to diffusional Brownian motion during the passage. Nevertheless, and somewhat counterintuitively, the diffusional Brownian motion determines the fundamental limitations of rapid DNA strand sequencing with a nanopore. We model both diffusional and conformational fluctuations in a Langevin description. It accounts well for passage time variations for DNA molecules of different lengths, and predicts conditions required for low-error-rate nanopore-strand DNA sequencing with nanopores.},

abstract = {Single molecule studies, at constant force, of the separation of double-stranded DNA into two separated single strands may provide information relevant to the dynamics of DNA replication. At constant applied force, theory predicts that the unzipped length as a function of time is characterized by jumps during which the strands separate rapidly, followed by long pauses where the number of separated base pairs remains constant. Here, we report previously uncharacterized observations of this striking behavior carried out on a number of identical single molecules simultaneously. When several single lambda phage molecules are subject to the same applied force, the pause positions are reproducible in each. This reproducibility shows that the positions and durations of the pauses in unzipping provide a sequence-dependent molecular fingerprint. For small forces, the DNA remains in a partially unzipped state for at least several hours. For larger forces, the separation is still characterized by jumps and pauses, but the double-stranded DNA will completely unzip in less than 30 min.},

abstract = {Helicases unwind dsDNA during replication, repair and recombination in an ATP-dependent reaction. The mechanism for helicase activity can be studied using oligonucleotide substrates to measure formation of single-stranded (ss) DNA from double-stranded (ds) DNA. This assay provides an 'all-or-nothing' readout because partially unwound intermediates are not detected. We have determined conditions under which an intermediate in the reaction cycle of Dda helicase can be detected by trapping a partially unwound substrate. The appearance of this intermediate supports a model in which each ssDNA product interacts with the helicase after unwinding has occurred. Kinetic analysis indicates that the intermediate appears during a slow step in the reaction cycle that is flanked by faster steps for unwinding. These observations demonstrate a complex mechanism containing nonuniform steps for a monomeric helicase. The potential biological significance of such a mechanism is discussed.},

abstract = {Controlling the wetting behaviour of liquids on surfaces is important for a variety of industrial applications such as water-repellent coatings1 and lubrication2 . Liquid behaviour on a surface can range from complete spreading, asin the ‘tears of wine' effect3,4, tominimal wetting as observed on a superhydrophobic lotus leaf5 . Controlling droplet movement is important in microfluidic liquid handling6 , on self-cleaning surfaces7 and in heat transfer8 . Droplet motion can be achieved by gradients of surface energy9–13. However, existing techniques require either a large gradient or a carefully prepared surface9 to overcome the effects of contact line pinning, which usually limit dropletmotion14. Here we show that two-component droplets of wellchosen miscible liquids such as propylene glycol and water deposited on clean glass are not subject to pinning and cause the motion of neighbouring droplets over a distance. Unlike the canonical predictions for these liquids on a high-energy surface, these droplets do not spread completely but exhibit an apparent contact angle. We demonstrate experimentally and analytically that these droplets are stabilized by evaporation-induced surface tension gradients and that they move in response to the vapour emitted by neighbouring droplets. Our fundamental understanding of this robust system enabled us to construct a wide variety of autonomous fluidic machines out of everyday materials.},

The adsorption of MTs on silicon substrates is an effective means for preserving the conformation of the MT and provides a convenient platform for electrical measurements. To improve the metallization of MTs, a photochemical route for gold reduction is adapted, which leads to continuous coverage.

There has been interest in using such a scheme to rapidly and inexpensively sequence single molecules of DNA. To establish reference current levels for adenine, cytosine, and thymine nucleotides, we measured the blockage currents following immobilization of single-stranded DNA polyadenine, polycytosine, and polythymine within a protein nanopore in chemical orientations in which either the 3' or the 5' end enters the pore. Immobilization resulted in low-noise measurements, yielding sharply defined current distributions for each base that enabled clear discrimination of the nucleotides in both orientations. In addition, we find that not only is the blockage current for each polyhomonucleotide orientation dependent, but also the changes in orientation affect the blockage currents for each base differently. This dependence can affect the ability to resolve polyadenine and polythymine; with the 5' end entering the pore, the separation between polyadenine and polythymine is double that observed for the 3' orientation. This suggests that, for better resolution, DNA should be threaded through the 5' end first in nanopore DNA sequencing experiments.},

When the trans-membrane voltage induced by an external electric field exceeds a certain threshold (normally 0.2-1 V), a rearrangement of the molecular structure of the membrane occurs, leading to pore formation in the membrane and a considerable increase in the cell membrane permeability to ions, molecules and even macromolecules. This phenomenon is, potentially, the basis for many in vivo applications such as electrochemotherapy and gene therapy, but still lacks a comprehensive theoretical basis. This article reviews the state of current electroporation theories and briefly considers current and potential applications in biology and medicine.},

abstract = {We developed a generalized technique to characterize polymer-nanopore interactions via single channel ionic current measurements. Physical interactions between analytes, such as DNA, proteins, or synthetic polymers, and a nanopore cause multiple discrete states in the current. We modeled the transitions of the current to individual states with an equivalent electrical circuit, which allowed us to describe the system response. This enabled the estimation of short-lived states that are presently not characterized by existing analysis techniques. Our approach considerably improves the range and resolution of single-molecule characterization with nanopores. For example, we characterized the residence times of synthetic polymers that are three times shorter than those estimated with existing algorithms. Because the molecule's residence time follows an exponential distribution, we recover nearly 20-fold more events per unit time that can be used for analysis. Furthermore, the measurement range was extended from 11 monomers to as few as 8. Finally, we applied this technique to recover a known sequence of single-stranded DNA from previously published ion channel recordings, identifying discrete current states with subpicoampere resolution.},

We focus on the biotin-streptavidin bond, which gains its ultimate strength on a time scale of milliseconds, due to existence of metastable binding states. As a consequence of the gluelike character of this widely used intermolecular bond, the velocity of molecular shuttles, active nanoscale transport systems based on biomolecular motors and their associated filaments, has to be optimized to permit efficient attachment of cargo via biotin-streptavidin linkages.

abstract = {OBJECT: Nonthermal irreversible electroporation (NTIRE) is a novel, minimally invasive technique to treat cancer, which is unique because of its nonthermal mechanism of tumor ablation. This paper evaluates the safety of an NTIRE procedure to lesion normal canine brain tissue.

METHODS: The NTIRE procedure involved placing electrodes into a targeted area of brain in 3 dogs and delivering a series of short and intense electric pulses. The voltages of the pulses applied were varied between dogs. Another dog was used as a sham control. One additional dog was treated at an extreme voltage to determine the upper safety limits of the procedure. Ultrasonography was used at the time of the procedure to determine if the lesions could be visualized intraoperatively. The volumes of ablated tissue were then estimated on postprocedure MR imaging. Histological brain sections were then analyzed to evaluate the lesions produced.

RESULTS: The animals tolerated the procedure with no apparent complications except for the animal that was treated at the upper voltage limit. The lesion volume appeared to decrease with decreasing voltage of applied pulses. Histological examination revealed cell death within the treated volume with a submillimeter transition zone between necrotic and normal brain.

CONCLUSIONS: The authors' results reveal that NTIRE at selected voltages can be safely administered in normal canine brain and that the volume of ablated tissue correlates with the voltage of the applied pulses. This preliminary study is the first step toward using NTIRE as a brain cancer treatment.},

We deposit nanoparticles of Au on microtubules by a new method involving photochemical reduction, in which MTs are mixed with Au3+ and the surfactant poly(oxyethelene) isooctylphenyl ether (Triton X-100 or TX-100). Exposure of the solution to UV irradiation reduces Au3+ to Au0. By varying the Au3+ and TX-100 concentration in the solution, Au particle size can be well controlled and uniform Au coverage on microtubules is observed. Multiple UV exposure steps induce Au particle growth and leads to dense coverage of Au on the MT.},

abstract = {We investigate the dynamics of polymer translocation through a nanopore using two-dimensional Langevin dynamics simulations. In the absence of an external driving force, we consider a polymer which is initially placed in the middle of the pore and study the escape time tau(e) required for the polymer to completely exit the pore on either side. The distribution of the escape times is wide and has a long tail. We find that tau(e) scales with the chain length N as tau(e) approximately N(1+2nu), where nu is the Flory exponent. For driven translocation, we concentrate on the influence of the friction coefficient xi, the driving force E, and the length of the chain N on the translocation time tau, which is defined as the time duration between the first monomer entering the pore and the last monomer leaving the pore. For strong driving forces, the distribution of translocation times is symmetric and narrow without a long tail and tau approximately E(-1). The influence of xi depends on the ratio between the driving and frictional forces. For intermediate xi, we find a crossover scaling for tau with N from tau approximately N(2nu) for relatively short chains to tau approximately N(1+nu) for longer chains. However, for higher xi, only tau approximately N(1+nu) is observed even for short chains, and there is no crossover behavior. This result can be explained by the fact that increasing xi increases the Rouse relaxation time of the chain, in which case even relatively short chains have no time to relax during translocation. Our results are in good agreement with previous simulations based on the fluctuating bond lattice model of polymers at intermediate friction values, but reveal additional features of dependency on friction.},

This identification was based on three consecutive ionic current states that correspond to passage of modified or unmodified CG dinucleotides and their immediate neighbors through the nanopore limiting aperture.

Each experiment analyzed a mixture of cytosine-, 5-methylcytosine-, and 5-hydroxymethylcytosine-bearing DNA strands that contained a marker that independently established the correct cytosine methylation status at the target CG of each molecule tested. To calculate error rates for these calls, we established decision boundaries using a variety of machine-learning methods. These error rates depended upon the identity of the bases immediately 5' and 3' of the targeted CG dinucleotide, and ranged from 1.7{\%} to 12.2{\%} for a single-pass read. We estimate that Q40 values (0.01{\%} error rates) for methylation status calls could be achieved by reading single molecules 5-19 times depending upon sequence context.},

As quadruplex DNAs may be important in the structure of telomere, centromere, triplet repeat and other DNAs, information about the details of the potassium-quadruplex DNA interactions are of interest. The structures of the 1:1 and the fully saturated, 2:1, potassium-DNA complexes of d(GGTTGGTGTGGTTGG) have been determined using the combination of experimental NMR results and restrained molecular dynamics simulations. The refined structures have been used to model the interactions at the potassium binding sites. Comparison of the 1:1 and 2:1 potassium:DNA structures indicates how potassium binding can determine the folding pattern of the DNA. In each binding site potassium interacts with the carbonyl oxygens of both the loop thymine residues and the guanine residues of the adjacent quartet.},

Here, we demonstrate the ability to control, measure, and make use of rapid temperature changes in fluid volumes that are commensurate with the size of single molecules. The method is based on attaching gold nanoparticles to a single nanometer-scale pore formed by a protein ion channel. Visible laser light incident on the nanoparticles causes a rapid and large increase of the adjacent solution temperature, which is estimated from the change in the nanopore ionic conductance. The temperature shift also affects the ability of individual molecules to enter into and interact with the nanopore. This technique could significantly improve sensor systems and force measurements based on single nanopores, thereby enabling a method for single molecule thermodynamics and kinetics.},

abstract = {Motor protein functions like adenosine triphosphate (ATP) hydrolysis or translocation along molecular substrates take place at nanometric scales and consequently depend on the amount of available thermal energy. The associated rates can hence be investigated by actively varying the temperature conditions. In this article, a thermally controlled magnetic tweezers (MT) system for single-molecule experiments at up to 40 °C is presented. Its compact thermostat module yields a precision of 0.1 °C and can in principle be tailored to any other surface-coupled microscopy technique, such as tethered particle motion (TPM), nanopore-based sensing of biomolecules, or super-resolution fluorescence imaging. The instrument is used to examine the temperature dependence of translocation along double-stranded (ds)DNA by individual copies of the protein complex AddAB, a helicase-nuclease motor involved in dsDNA break repair. Despite moderately lower mean velocities measured at sub-saturating ATP concentrations, almost identical estimates of the enzymatic reaction barrier (around 21-24 kB T) are obtained by comparing results from MT and stopped-flow bulk assays. Single-molecule rates approach ensemble values at optimized chemical energy conditions near the motor, which can withstand opposing loads of up to 14 piconewtons (pN). Having proven its reliability, the temperature-controlled MT described herein will eventually represent a routinely applied method within the toolbox for nano-biotechnology.},

@article{Howard1988,
abstract = {A comparative study has been carried out of the effects of taxol on the polymerizations into microtubules of microtubule-associated protein-free tubulin, prepared by the modified Weisenberg procedure, and of the tubulin-colchicine complex into large aggregates. Taxol enhances, to a much greater extent, the stability of microtubules than that of the tubulin-colchicine polymers so that, with highly purified tubulin, assembly into microtubules takes place at 10 degrees C, even in the absence of exogenous GTP. The polymerization of tubulin-colchicine requires both heat and GTP, and the process is reversed by cooling. These results indicate that in both systems polymerization is linked to interactions with taxol and GTP, the interplay of linkage free energies imparting the observed polymer stabilities. In the case of microtubule formation, the linkage free energy provided by taxol binding is approximately -3.0 kcal/mol of alpha-beta-tubulin dimer, whereas this quantity is reduced to approximately -0.5 kcal/mol in tubulin-colchicine, indicating the expenditure of much more binding free energy in the latter case for overcoming unfavorable factors, such as steric hindrance and geometric strain. The difference in the effect of GTP on the two polymerization processes reflects the respective abilities of the bindings of taxol to the two states of tubulin to overcome the loss of the linkage free energy of GTP binding. Analysis of the linkages leads to the conclusions that taxol need not change qualitatively the mechanism of microtubule assembly and that tubulin with the E-site unoccupied by nucleotide should have the capacity to form microtubules, the reaction being extremely weak.},

abstract = {By video contrast microscopy, individual microtubules formed from pure tubulin in the presence of taxol were studied in constant electric fields. At nearly physiological conditions, i.e., in a buffer at pH 6.8 and 120 mM ionic strength, suspended microtubules moved towards the anode with an electrophoretic mobility of approximately 2.6 x 10(-4) cm(2)/V s, corresponding to an unbalanced negative charge of 0.19 electron charges per tubulin dimer. Strikingly, this value is lower by a factor of at least 50 than that calculated from crystallographic data for the non-assembled tubulin dimer. Moreover, the taxol-stabilized microtubules had an isoelectric point of about pH 4.2 which is significantly lower than that known for the tubulin monomers. This indicates that microtubule formation is accompanied by substantial changes of charge distribution within the tubulin subunits. Constant electric fields were shown to affect also the orientation of microtubules gliding across a kinesin-coated surface at pH 6.8.},

abstract = {In physiological settings, nucleic-acid translocases must act on substrates occupied by other proteins, and an increasingly appreciated role of translocases is to catalyse protein displacement from RNA and DNA. However, little is known regarding the inevitable collisions that must occur, and the fate of protein obstacles and the mechanisms by which they are evicted from DNA remain unexplored. Here we sought to establish the mechanistic basis for protein displacement from DNA using RecBCD as a model system. Using nanofabricated curtains of DNA and multicolour single-molecule microscopy, we visualized collisions between a model translocase and different DNA-bound proteins in real time. We show that the DNA translocase RecBCD can disrupt core RNA polymerase, holoenzymes, stalled elongation complexes and transcribing RNA polymerases in either head-to-head or head-to-tail orientations, as well as EcoRI(E111Q), lac repressor and even nucleosomes. RecBCD did not pause during collisions and often pushed proteins thousands of base pairs before evicting them from DNA. We conclude that RecBCD overwhelms obstacles through direct transduction of chemomechanical force with no need for specific protein-protein interactions, and that proteins can be removed from DNA through active disruption mechanisms that act on a transition state intermediate as they are pushed from one nonspecific site to the next.},

abstract = {Single trimeric channels of the general bacterial porin, OmpF, were reconstituted into planar lipid membranes and their conductance, selectivity, and open-channel noise were studied over a wide range of proton concentrations. From pH 1 to pH 12, channel transport properties displayed three characteristic regimes. First, in acidic solutions, channel conductance is a strong function of pH; it increases by approximately threefold as the proton concentration decreases from pH 1 to pH 5. This rise in conductance is accompanied by a sharp increase in cation transport number and by pronounced open-channel low-frequency current noise with a peak at approximately pH 2.5. Random stepwise transients with amplitudes at approximately 1/5 of the monomer conductance are major contributors to this noise. Second, over the middle range (pH 5/pH 9), channel conductance and selectivity stay virtually constant; open channel noise is at its minimum. Third, over the basic range (pH 9/pH 12), channel conductance and cation selectivity start to grow again with an onset of a higher frequency open-channel noise. We attribute these effects to the reversible protonation of channel residues whose pH-dependent charge influences transport by direct interactions with ions passing through the channel.},

abstract = {A simulated annealing method is described for training hidden Markov models and producing multiple sequence alignments from initially unaligned protein or DNA sequences. Simulated annealing in turn uses a dynamic programming algorithm for correctly sampling suboptimal multiple alignments according to their probability and a Boltzmann temperature factor. The quality of simulated annealing alignments is evaluated on structural alignments of ten different protein families, and compared to the performance of other HMMtr aining methods and the ClnstalW program. Simulated annealing is better able to find near-global optima in the multiple alignment probability landscape than the other tested HMMtra ining methods. Neither ClustalW nor simulated annealing produce consistently better alignments compared to each other. Examinationo f the specific cases in which ClustalW outperforms simulated annealing, and vice versa, provides insight into the strengths and weaknesses of current hidden Markov model approaches.},

A crucial advantage of protein nanopores is that site-directed mutagenesis permits precise tuning of their properties. Here, by augmenting the internal positive charge within the alpha-hemolysin pore and varying its distribution, we increase the frequency of translocation of a 92-nt single-stranded DNA through the pore at +120 mV by approximately 10-fold over the wild-type protein and dramatically lower the voltage threshold at which translocation occurs, e.g., by 50 mV for 1 event.s(-1).muM(-1). Further, events in which DNA enters the pore, but is not immediately translocated, are almost eliminated. These experiments provide a basis for improved nucleic acid analysis with protein nanopores, which might be translated to solid-state nanopores by using chemical surface modification.},

The theory ``quantitatively'' reproduces the experimental results for DNA that is subject to a constant force. We also treat the problems of a semiflexible chain in a nematic field. In the limit of weak nematic field strength our treatment reproduces the exact results for chain expansion parallel to the director. When the strength of nematic field is large, a situation in which there are two equivalent minima in the free energy, the intrinsically meanfield approach yields incorrect results for the dependence of the persistence length on the nematic field.},

Experimental evidence indicates that their mechanical properties do not play a significant role in the generation of such regular patterns. This spatial organization seems closely related to their dynamic behavior. Here we use mathematical modeling to define conditions under which microtubule dynamics result in self organization. We demonstrate that random diffusional processes can generate regular microtubule organizations under specified kinetic conditions which are found to be compatible with known properties of tubulin polymers. The organizing forces are the tubulin concentration gradients which are generated by the polymer growth. The present analysis has been restricted to the phase of establishment of the microtubule network. The same conceptual framework, applied to steady state pattern maintenance suggests that the kinetic requirements for self organization might ultimately be responsible for such extraordinary in vivo microtubule dynamics, as the parid turnover and "dynamic instability" of the interphase network.},

Single-channel recording of the translocation duration and current flow during traversal of individual polynucleotides yielded a unique pattern of events for each of the several polymers tested. Statistical data derived from this pattern of events demonstrate that in several cases a nanopore can distinguish between polynucleotides of similar length and composition that differ only in sequence. Studies of temperature effects on the translocation process show that translocation duration scales as approximately T(-2). A strong correlation exists between the temperature dependence of the event characteristics and the tendency of some polymers to form secondary structure. Because nanopores can rapidly discriminate and characterize unlabeled DNA molecules at low copy number, refinements of the experimental approach demonstrated here could eventually provide a low-cost high-throughput method of analyzing DNA polynucleotides.},

@article{Flyvbjerg1996,
abstract = {An effective theory is formulated for the dynamics of the guanosine triphosphate GTP cap believed to stabilize growing microtubules. The theory provides a ‘‘coarse-grained'' description of the cap's dynamics. ‘‘Microscopic'' details, such as the microtubule lattice structure and the fate of its individual tubulin dimers, are ignored. In this cap model, GTP hydrolysis is assumed to be stochastic and uncoupled to microtubule growth. Different rates of hydrolysis are assumed for GTP in the cap's interior and for GTP at its boundary with hydrolyzed parts of the microtubule. Expectation values and probability distributions relating to available experimental data are derived. Caps are found to be short and the total rate of hydrolysis at a microtubule end is found to be dynamically coupled to growth. The so-called catastrophe rate is a simple function of the microtubule growth rate and fits experimental data. A constant nonzero catastrophe rate, identical for both microtubule ends, is predicted at large growth rates. The delay time for dilution-induced catastrophes is stochastic with a simple distribution that fits the experimental one and, like the experimental one, does not depend on the rate of microtubule growth before dilution. The GTP content of microtubules is found and its rate of hydrolysis is determined under the circumstances created in an experiment designed to measure this GTP content. It is concluded that this experiment's failure to register any GTP content is consistent with the model. A recent experimental result for the size of the minimal cap that can stabilize a microtubule is shown to agree with the result predicted by the cap model, after its parameters have been extracted from previous experimental results. Thus the effective theory and cap model presented here provide a unified description of several apparently contradictory experimental data. Experimental results for the catastrophe rate at different concentrations of magnesium ions and of microtubule associated proteins are discussed in terms of the model. Feasible experiments are suggested that can provide decisive tests of the model and determine its three parameters with higher precision.},

An ionic current passing through a small pore would directly map the sequence of single stranded DNA (ssDNA) driven through the constriction. The pore protein, MspA, derived from Mycobacterium smegmatis, has a short and narrow channel constriction ideally suited for nanopore sequencing. To study MspA's ability to resolve nucleotides, we held ssDNA within the pore using a biotin-NeutrAvidin complex. We show that homopolymers of adenine, cytosine, thymine, and guanine in MspA exhibit much larger current differences than in $\alpha$-hemolysin. Additionally, methylated cytosine is distinguishable from unmethylated cytosine. We establish that single nucleotide substitutions within homopolymer ssDNA can be detected when held in MspA's constriction. Using genomic single nucleotide polymorphisms, we demonstrate that single nucleotides within random DNA can be identified. Our results indicate that MspA has high signal-to-noise ratio and the single nucleotide sensitivity desired for nanopore sequencing devices.},

On addition of an oligonucleotide 8 bases in length and with a sequence complementary to the tethered DNA strand, current blockades with durations of hundreds of milliseconds occurred, representing hybridization events of individual oligonucleotides to the tethered DNA strand. Kinetic constants for DNA duplex formation at the single molecule level were derived and found to be consistent with established literature values for macroscopic duplex formation. The resultant equilibrium constant for duplex formation in the nanopore was found to be close to the experimentally derived constant for duplex formation in solution. A good agreement between the equilibrium constants for duplex formation in the nanopore and in solution was also found for two other oligonucleotide pairs. In addition, the nanopore recordings revealed details of the kinetics difficult to obtain by conventional methods, like surface plasmon resonance, which measure ensemble properties. By investigating the temperature dependence of DNA duplex formation at the single molecule level, the standard enthalpy and entropy of the interaction could be obtained.},

abstract = {A detailed understanding of the kinetics of DNA motion though nanometer-scale pores is important for the successful development of many of the proposed next-generation rapid DNA sequencing and analysis methods. Many of these approaches require DNA motion through nanopores to be slowed by several orders of magnitude from its native translocation velocity so that the translocation times for individual nucleotides fall within practical timescales for detection. With the increased dwell time of DNA in the pore, DNA-pore interactions begin to play an increasingly important role in translocation kinetics. In previous work, we and others observed that when the DNA dwell time in the pore is substantial ({\textgreater}1 ms), DNA motion in $\alpha$-hemolysin ($\alpha$-HL) pores leads to nonexponential kinetics in the escape of DNA out of the pore. Here we show that a three-state model for DNA escape, involving stochastic binding interactions of DNA with the pore, accurately reproduces the experimental data. In addition, we investigate the sequence dependence of the DNA escape process and show that the interaction strength of adenine with $\alpha$-HL is substantially lower relative to cytosine. Our results indicate a difference in the process by which DNA moves through an $\alpha$-HL nanopore when the motion is fast (microsecond timescale) as compared with when it is slow (millisecond timescale) and strongly influenced by DNA-pore interactions of the kind reported here. We also show the ability of wild-type $\alpha$-HL to detect and distinguish between 5-methylcytosine and cytosine based on differences in the absolute ionic current through the pore in the presence of these two nucleotides. The results we present here regarding sequence-dependent (and dwell-time-dependent) DNA-pore interaction kinetics will have important implications for the design of methods for DNA analysis through reduced-velocity motion in nanopores.},

abstract = {About 40 years ago, Helfrich introduced an elastic model to explain shapes and shape transitions of cells (Z Naturforsch C, 1973; 28:693). This seminal article stimulated numerous theoretical as well as experimental investigations and created new research fields. In particular, the predictive power of his approach was demonstrated in a large variety of lipid model system. Here in this review, we focus on the development with respect to planar lipid membranes in external electric fields. Stimulated by the early work of Helfrich on electric field forces acting on liposomes, we extended his early approach to understand the kinetics of lipid membrane rupture. First, we revisit the main forces determining the kinetics of membrane rupture followed by an overview on various experiments. Knowledge on the kinetics of defect formation may help to design stable membranes or serve for novel mechanism for controlled release.},

abstract = {DNA hairpins produce ionic current signatures when captured by the alpha-hemolysin nano-scale pore under conditions of single molecule electrophoresis. Gating patterns produced by individual DNA hairpins when captured can be used to distinguish differences of a single base pair or even a single nucleotide [Vercoutere,W.A. et al. (2003) Nucleic Acids Res., 31, 1311-1318]. Here we investigate the mechanism(s) that may account for the ionic current gating signatures. The ionic current resistance profile of conductance states produced by DNA hairpin molecules with 3-12 bp stems showed a plateau in resistance between 10 and 12 bp, suggesting that hairpins with 10-12 bp stems span the pore vestibule. DNA hairpins with 9-12 bp stems produced gating signatures with the same relative conductance states. Systematic comparison of the conductance state dwell times and apparent activation energies for a series of 9-10 bp DNA hairpins suggest that the 3' and 5' ends interact at or near the limiting aperture within the vestibule of the alpha-hemolysin pore. The model presented may be useful in predicting and interpreting DNA detection using nanopore detectors. In addition, this well-defined molecular system may prove useful for investigating models of ligand-gated channels in biological membranes.},

abstract = {Enzymatic reactions occur in a crowded and confined environment in vivo, containing proteins, RNA and DNA. Previous reports have shown that interactions between macromolecules, and reactions rates differ significantly between crowded environments and dilute buffers. However, the direct effect of crowding on the level of high-resolution structures of macromolecules has not been extensively analyzed and is not well understood. Here we analyze the effect of macromolecular crowding on structure and function of the human translation initiation factors eIF4A, a two-domain DEAD-Box helicase, the HEAT-1 domain of eIF4G, and their complex. We find that crowding enhances the ATPase activity of eIF4A, which correlates with a shift to a more compact structure as revealed with small-angle X-ray scattering. However, the individual domains of eIF4A, or the eIF4G-HEAT-1 domain alone show little structural changes due to crowding except for flexible regions. Thus, the effect of macromolecular crowding on activity and structure need to be taken into account when evaluating enzyme activities and structures of multidomain proteins, proteins with flexible regions, or protein complexes obtained by X-ray crystallography, NMR, or other structural methods.},

abstract = {We have measured the ionic current blockages produced by single molecules of sodium poly(styrene sulfonate) passing through an alpha-hemolysin protein pore under an electric field. Most of the blockage events were composed of one or two blockage levels of ionic current. By analyzing the statistics of different event types for different polymer lengths, applied voltages, and pH conditions, we have identified the molecular mechanism behind the two-level blockages. Our analysis of the data shows that not all blockages are successful translocation events and the propensity of successful translocation can be tuned by pH gradients across the protein pore. We interpret our results as the change in protein-polymer interaction via protonation of charged amino acid residues of alpha-hemolysin pore. In addition, we have constructed a stochastic theory for polymer translocation through alpha-hemolysin pore with tunable polymer-pore interactions. The theoretical calculations capture many features observed in our experiments.},

It describes the buckling of a single microtubule (MT) bundle within an elastic network formed by other similarly aligned and buckling bundles and unaligned MTs. Phase contrast and polarization microscopy studies of the temporal evolution of the pattern imply that the polymerization of MTs within the bundles creates the driving compressional force. Using the measured rate of buckling, the established MT force-velocity curve and the pattern wavelength, we obtain reasonable estimates for the MT bundle bending rigidity and the elastic constant of the network. The analysis implies that the bundles buckle as solid rods.},

abstract = {Electroporation designates the use of short high-voltage pulses to overcome the barrier of the cell membrane. By applying an external electric field, which just surpasses the capacitance of the cell membrane, transient and reversible breakdown of the membrane can be induced. This transient, permeabilized state can be used to load cells with a variety of different molecules, either through simple diffusion in the case of small molecules, or through electrophoretically driven processes allowing passage through the destabilized membrane--as is the case for DNA transfer. Initially developed for gene transfer, electroporation is now in use for delivery of a large variety of molecules: From ions to drugs, dyes, tracers, antibodies, and oligonucleotides to RNA and DNA. Electroporation has proven useful both in vitro, in vivo and in patients, where drug delivery to malignant tumours has been performed. Whereas initial electroporation procedures caused considerable cell damage, developments over the past decades have led to sophistication of equipment and optimization of protocols. The electroporation procedures used in many laboratories could be optimized with limited effort. This review (i) outlines the theory of electroporation, (ii) discusses factors of importance for optimization of electroporation protocols for mammalian cells, (iii) addresses particular concerns when using electroporation in vivo, e.g. effects on blood flow and considerations regarding choice of electrodes, (iv) describes DNA electrotransfer with emphasis on use in the in vivo setting, and (v) sums up data on safety and efficacy of electroporation used to enhance delivery of chemotherapy to tumours in cancer patients.},

abstract = {The "molecular Coulter counter" concept has been used to study transport of ATP molecules through the nanometer-scale aqueous pore of the voltage-dependent mitochondrial ion channel, VDAC. We examine the ATP-induced current fluctuations and the change in average current through a single fully open channel reconstituted into a planar lipid bilayer. At high salt concentration (1 M NaCl), the addition of ATP reduces both solution conductivity and channel conductance, but the effect on the channel is several times stronger and shows saturation behavior even at 50 mM ATP concentration. These results and simple steric considerations indicate pronounced attraction of ATP molecules to VDAC's aqueous pore and permit us to evaluate the effect of a single ATP molecule on channel conductance. ATP addition also generates an excess noise in the ionic current through the channel. Analysis of this excess noise shows that its spectrum is flat in the accessible frequency interval up to several kilohertz. ATP exchange between the pore and the bulk is fast enough not to display any dispersion at these frequencies. By relating the low-frequency spectral density of the noise to the equilibrium diffusion of ATP molecules in the aqueous pore, we calculate a diffusion coefficient D = (1.6-3.3)10(-11) m2/s. This is one order of magnitude smaller than the ATP diffusion coefficient in the bulk, but it agrees with recent results on ATP flux measurements in multichannel membranes using the luciferin/luciferase method.},

The approach relies on modeling the possible sources of uncertainty that occur as DNA transits through the nanopore and finds the sequence that best explains multiple reads of the same region. PoreSeq increases nanopore sequencing read accuracy of M13 bacteriophage DNA from 85{\%} to 99{\%} at 100× coverage.

abstract = {Kinesin is a microtubule-associated protein, converting chemical into mechanical energy. Based on its ability to also work outside cells, it has recently been shown that this biological machinery might be usable for nanotechnological developments. Possible applications of the kinesin-based motor system require the solution of numerous methodological and technical problems, including the orientation of force generation into a desired direction and the determination of the tolerable roughness of the surfaces used, the minimal free vertical space still enabling force-generating activity, and the temporal stability of the system. This paper reports on the example of microtubules gliding across kinesin-coated surfaces and shows that the force-generating system needs a minimal free working space of about 100 nm height and works up to 3 h with nearly constant velocity. Individual microtubules were observed to cover distances of at least 1 mm without being detached from the surface and to overcome steps of up to 286 nm height. In addition, mechanically induced flow fields were shown to force gliding microtubules to move in one and the same direction. This result is regarded as being an essential step towards future developments of kinesin-based microdevices as this approach avoids neutralization of single forces acting in opposite directions.},

Highly ordered protein assemblies of tubular structure and high geometric aspect ratio are used as bioorganic templates for the bottom-up synthesis of metal nanostructures. When the biotemplate is coupled to an appropriate chemical reaction, metal is generated in situ and deposited along the backbone of the biostructure.

abstract = {Over the last few decades, the in vitro motility assay has been performed to probe the biophysical and chemo-mechanical properties as well as the self-organization process of biomolecular motor systems such as actin-myosin and microtubule-kinesin. However, aggression of the reactive oxygen species (ROS) and concomitant termination of the activity of biomolecular motors during investigation remains a drawback of this assay. Despite enzymatic protection that makes use of a combination of glucose, glucose oxidase, and catalase, the active lifetime of biomolecular motors is found to be only a few hours and this short lifetime restricts further study on those systems. We have solved this problem by using a newly developed system of the in vitro motility assay that is conducted in an inert nitrogen gas atmosphere free of ROS. Using microtubule-kinesin as a model system we have shown that our system has prolonged the active lifetime of the biomolecular motor until several days and even a week by protecting it from oxidative damage.},

@article{Pinot2009,
abstract = {The regulation of the cytoskeleton is essential for the proper organization and function of eukaryotic cells. For instance, radial arrays of microtubules (MTs), called asters, determine the intracellular localization of organelles. Asters can be generated through either MT organizing center (MTOC)-dependent regulation or self-organization processes. In vivo, this occurs within the cell boundaries. How the properties of these boundaries affect MT organization is unknown. To approach this question, we studied the organization of microtubules inside droplets of eukaryotic cellular extracts with varying sizes and elastic properties. Our results show that the size of the droplet determined the final steady-state MT organization, which changed from symmetric asters to asymmetric semi-asters and, finally, to cortical bundles. A simple physical model recapitulated these results, identifying the main physical parameters of the transitions. The use of vesicles with more elastic boundaries resulted in very different morphologies of microtubule structures, such as asymmetrical semi-asters, "Y-branching" organizations, cortical-like bundles, "rackets," and bundled organizations. Our results highlight the importance of taking into account the physical characteristics of the cellular confinement to understand the formation of cytoskeleton structures in vivo.},

@article{Fischer2009,
abstract = {Biosensors can be miniaturized by either injecting smaller volumes into micro- and nanofluidic devices or immersing increasingly sophisticated particles known as ‘smart dust' into the sample. The term ‘smart dust' originally referred to cubic-millimetre wireless semiconducting sensor devices that could invisibly monitor the environment in buildings and public spaces1, but later it also came to include functional micrometre-sized porous silicon particles used to monitor yet smaller environments2,3. The principal challenge in designing smart dust biosensors is integrating transport functions with energy supply into the device. Here, we report a hybrid micro- device that is powered by ATP and relies on antibody- functionalized microtubules and kinesin motors to transport the target analyte into a detection region. The transport step replaces the wash step in traditional double-antibody sandwich assays. Owing to their small size and autonomous function, we envision that large numbers of such smart dust biosensors could be inserted into organisms or distributed into the environment for remote sensing.},

abstract = {An efficient computational method has been identified that uses B3LYP density functional theory, IEF-PCM solvation modeling with a modified UFF cavity, and Boltzmann weighting of tautomers to predict the site-specific and global pKa of DNA nucleobases and their oxidation products. The method has been used to evaluate the acidity of guanidinohydantoin (Gh) and spiroiminodihydantoin (Sp), two highly mutagenic guanine oxidation products. The trend observed for the pKa values of Gh (9.64 and 8.15) is consistent with the experimentally observed values for guanidine cation (13.7) and hydantoin (9.16). The pKa1(calc) value for deprotonation of Sp cation (Sp+ --{\textgreater} Sp) is very close to the experimentally observed pKa1 for 8-oxoG and is consistent with the similarity in their structures. The data suggest that the imide (N7) proton in Sp is considerably more acidic than that in Gh, possibly due to the presence of the through-space electronic effects of the carbonyl group located at C6. This difference in the acidity of Gh and Sp may be an indication of their potential toxicity and mutagenicity in vivo and remains a fertile area for experimental study.},

abstract = {Accurate knowledge of the thermodynamic properties of nucleic acids is crucial to predicting their structure and stability. To date most measurements of base-pair free energies in DNA are obtained in thermal denaturation experiments, which depend on several assumptions. Here we report measurements of the DNA base-pair free energies based on a simplified system, the mechanical unzipping of single DNA molecules. By combining experimental data with a physical model and an optimization algorithm for analysis, we measure the 10 unique nearest-neighbor base-pair free energies with 0.1 kcal mol(-1) precision over two orders of magnitude of monovalent salt concentration. We find an improved set of standard energy values compared with Unified Oligonucleotide energies and a unique set of 10 base-pair-specific salt-correction values. The latter are found to be strongest for AA/TT and weakest for CC/GG. Our unique energy values and salt corrections improve predictions of DNA unzipping forces and are fully compatible with melting temperatures for oligos. The method should make it possible to obtain free energies, enthalpies, and entropies in conditions not accessible by bulk methodologies.},

These motors can move in a specific direction over either microtubules (kinesins, dynein) or actin filaments (myosins). The basic traffic rules governing polarized transport on the neuronal cytoskeleton have long remained unclear, but recent work has revealed several fundamental sorting principles based on differences in the cytoskeletal organization in axons versus dendrites. We will highlight the basic characteristics of the neuronal cytoskeleton and review existing evidence for microtubule and actin based traffic rules in polarized neuronal transport. We will propose a model in which polarized sorting of cargo is established by recruiting or activating the proper subset of motor proteins, which are subsequently guided to specific directions by the polarized organization of the neuronal cytoskeleton.},

AgCl deposited on a conducting support photocatalyzes the oxidation of water to O2 in the presence of a small excess of silver ions in solution. The light sensitivity in the visible part of the spectrum is due to self-sensitization caused by reduced silver species. Anodic polarization reoxidizes the reduced silver species. Considerable improvement of sensitivity has been observed with AgBr sensitized AgCl photoanodes. To test its water splitting capability, the AgCl photoanode was combined with hydrogen-producing semiconductors, such as a platinized silicon solar cell and platinized p-GaInP2. AgCl layers were employed in the anodic part and the H2 evolving semiconductors in the cathodic part of a photoelectrochemical cell for light-assisted water splitting. The AgCl electrodes were characterized with surface photovoltage spectroscopy (SPS), which identified the transition from the valence band to silver cluster levels and by in-situ UV/vis diffuse reflectance spectroscopy, which detects the reduced and reoxidized silver species.},

Each motor is highly specialized and carries out a distinct function within the cell. Some have even evolved sophisticated mechanisms to ensure quality control during nanomanufacturing processes, whether to correct errors in biosynthesis or to detect and permit the repair of damaged transport highways. In general, these nanomotors consume chemical energy in order to undergo a series of shape changes that let them interact sequentially with other molecules. Here we review some of the many tasks that biomotors perform and analyse their underlying design principles from an engineering perspective.

abstract = {Curli are functional amyloid fibres that constitute the major protein component of the extracellular matrix in pellicle biofilms formed by Bacteroidetes and Proteobacteria (predominantly of the $\alpha$ and $\gamma$ classes). They provide a fitness advantage in pathogenic strains and induce a strong pro-inflammatory response during bacteraemia. Curli formation requires a dedicated protein secretion machinery comprising the outer membrane lipoprotein CsgG and two soluble accessory proteins, CsgE and CsgF. Here we report the X-ray structure of Escherichia coli CsgG in a non-lipidated, soluble form as well as in its native membrane-extracted conformation. CsgG forms an oligomeric transport complex composed of nine anticodon-binding-domain-like units that give rise to a 36-stranded $\beta$-barrel that traverses the bilayer and is connected to a cage-like vestibule in the periplasm. The transmembrane and periplasmic domains are separated by a 0.9-nm channel constriction composed of three stacked concentric phenylalanine, asparagine and tyrosine rings that may guide the extended polypeptide substrate through the secretion pore. The specificity factor CsgE forms a nonameric adaptor that binds and closes off the periplasmic face of the secretion channel, creating a 24,000 {\AA}(3) pre-constriction chamber. Our structural, functional and electrophysiological analyses imply that CsgG is an ungated, non-selective protein secretion channel that is expected to employ a diffusion-based, entropy-driven transport mechanism.},

abstract = {We report that in heart cells, physiologic stretch rapidly activates reduced-form nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH) oxidase 2 (NOX2) to produce reactive oxygen species (ROS) in a process dependent on microtubules (X-ROS signaling). ROS production occurs in the sarcolemmal and t-tubule membranes where NOX2 is located and sensitizes nearby ryanodine receptors (RyRs) in the sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR). This triggers a burst of Ca2+ sparks, the elementary Ca2+ release events in heart. Although this stretch-dependent “tuning” of RyRs increases Ca2+ signaling sensitivity in healthy cardiomyocytes, in disease it enables Ca2+ sparks to trigger arrhythmogenic Ca2+ waves. In the mouse model of Duchenne muscular dystrophy, hyperactive X-ROS signaling contributes to cardiomyopathy through aberrant Ca2+ release from the SR. X-ROS signaling thus provides a mechanistic explanation for the mechanotransduction of Ca2+ release in the heart and offers fresh therapeutic possibilities.},

We present the Continuous Profile Model (CPM), a generative model in which each observed time series is a non-uniformly subsampled version of a single latent trace, to which local rescaling and additive noise are applied. After unsupervised training, the learned trace represents a canonical, high resolution fusion of all the replicates. As well, an alignment in time and scale of each observation to this trace can be found by inference in the model. We apply CPM to successfully align speech signals from multiple speakers and sets of Liquid Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry proteomic data.},

This was exemplified by the detection of a drug resistance-conferring mutation in the reverse transcriptase gene of HIV.

The theoretical results show a larger persistence length for ssDNA than ordinary synthetic polymers, and the obtained length per base is larger than the reported value obtained from single molecule force measurements.

abstract = {A single oligonucleotide was covalently attached to a genetically engineered subunit of the heptameric protein pore, alpha-hemolysin, to allow DNA duplex formation inside the pore lumen. Single-channel current recording was used to study the properties of the modified pore. On addition of an oligonucleotide 8 bases in length and with a sequence complementary to the tethered DNA strand, current blockades with durations of hundreds of milliseconds occurred, representing hybridization events of individual oligonucleotides to the tethered DNA strand. Kinetic constants for DNA duplex formation at the single molecule level were derived and found to be consistent with established literature values for macroscopic duplex formation. The resultant equilibrium constant for duplex formation in the nanopore was found to be close to the experimentally derived constant for duplex formation in solution. A good agreement between the equilibrium constants for duplex formation in the nanopore and in solution was also found for two other oligonucleotide pairs. In addition, the nanopore recordings revealed details of the kinetics difficult to obtain by conventional methods, like surface plasmon resonance, which measure ensemble properties. By investigating the temperature dependence of DNA duplex formation at the single molecule level, the standard enthalpy and entropy of the interaction could be obtained.},

abstract = {Current models of microtubule assembly from pure tubulin involve a nucleation phase followed by microtubule elongation at a constant polymer number. Both the rate of microtubule nucleation and elongation are thought to be tightly influenced by the free GTP-tubulin concentration, in a law of mass action-dependent manner. However, these basic hypotheses have remained largely untested due to a lack of data reporting actual measurements of the microtubule length and number concentration during microtubule assembly.Here, we performed simultaneous measurements of the polymeric tubulin concentration, of the free GTP-tubulin concentration, and of the microtubule length and number concentration in both polymerizing and depolymerizing conditions. In agreement with previous work we find that the microtubule nucleation rate is strongly dependent on the initial GTP-tubulin concentration. But we find that microtubule nucleation persists during microtubule elongation. At any given initial tubulin-GTP concentration, the microtubule nucleation rate remains constant during polymer assembly, despite the wide variation in free GTP-tubulin concentration. We also find a remarkable constancy of the rate of microtubule elongation during assembly. Apparently, the rate of microtubule elongation is intrinsic to the polymers, insensitive to large variations of the free GTP-tubulin concentration. Finally we observe that when, following assembly, microtubules depolymerize below the free GTP-tubulin critical concentration, the rate-limiting factor for disassembly is the frequency of microtubule catastrophe. At all time-points during disassembly, the microtubule catastrophe frequency is independent of the free GTP-tubulin concentration but, as the microtubule nucleation rate, is strongly dependent on the initial free GTP-tubulin concentration. We conclude that the dynamics of both microtubule assembly and disassembly depend largely on factors other than the free GTP-tubulin concentration. We propose that intrinsic structural factors and endogenous regulators, whose concentration varies with the initial conditions, are also major determinants of these dynamics.},

However, nanopores are typically fabricated in insulating membranes that are as thick as 15 bases, which makes it difficult for the devices to read individual bases. Graphene is only 0.335 nm thick (equivalent to the spacing between two bases in a DNA chain) and could therefore provide a suitable membrane for sequencing applications. Here, we show that a solid-state nanopore can be integrated with a graphene nanoribbon transistor to create a sensor for DNA translocation. As DNA molecules move through the pore, the device can simultaneously measure drops in ionic current and changes in local voltage in the transistor, which can both be used to detect the molecules. We examine the correlation between these two signals and use the ionic current measurements as a real-time control of the graphene-based sensing device.},

@article{Smith2011,
abstract = {Recently there has been intense and growing interest in the non-thermal biological effects of nanosecond electric pulses, particularly apoptosis induction. These effects have been hypothesized to result from the widespread creation of small, lipidic pores in the plasma and organelle membranes of cells (supra-electroporation) and, more specifically, ionic and molecular transport through these pores. Here we show that transport occurs overwhelmingly after pulsing. First, we show that the electrical drift distance for typical charged solutes during nanosecond pulses (up to 100 ns), even those with very large magnitudes (up to 10 MV/m), ranges from only a fraction of the membrane thickness (5 nm) to several membrane thicknesses. This is much smaller than the diameter of a typical cell (∼16 $\mu$m), which implies that molecular drift transport during nanosecond pulses is necessarily minimal. This implication is not dependent on assumptions about pore density or the molecular flux through pores. Second, we show that molecular transport resulting from post-pulse diffusion through minimum-size pores is orders of magnitude larger than electrical drift-driven transport during nanosecond pulses. While field-assisted charge entry and the magnitude of flux favor transport during nanosecond pulses, these effects are too small to overcome the orders of magnitude more time available for post-pulse transport. Therefore, the basic conclusion that essentially all transmembrane molecular transport occurs post-pulse holds across the plausible range of relevant parameters. Our analysis shows that a primary direct consequence of nanosecond electric pulses is the creation (or maintenance) of large populations of small pores in cell membranes that govern post-pulse transmembrane transport of small ions and molecules.},

abstract = {Based on an analysis of the diffusive heat flow equation, we determine limits on the localization of heating of soft materials and biological tissues by electromagnetically excited nanoparticles. For heating by rf magnetic fields or heating by typical continuous wave lasers, the local temperature rise adjacent to magnetic or metallic nanoparticles is negligible. However, heat dissipation for a large number of nanoparticles dispersed in a macroscopic region of a material or tissue produces a global temperature rise that is orders of magnitude larger than the temperature rise adjacent to a single nanoparticle. One approach for producing a significant local temperature rise on nanometer length scales is heating by high-power pulsed or modulated lasers with low duty cycle.},

abstract = {We describe a novel single molecule nanopore-based sequencing by synthesis (Nano-SBS) strategy that can accurately distinguish four bases by detecting 4 different sized tags released from 5'-phosphate-modified nucleotides. The basic principle is as follows. As each nucleotide is incorporated into the growing DNA strand during the polymerase reaction, its tag is released and enters a nanopore in release order. This produces a unique ionic current blockade signature due to the tag's distinct chemical structure, thereby determining DNA sequence electronically at single molecule level with single base resolution. As proof of principle, we attached four different length PEG-coumarin tags to the terminal phosphate of 2'-deoxyguanosine-5'-tetraphosphate. We demonstrate efficient, accurate incorporation of the nucleotide analogs during the polymerase reaction, and excellent discrimination among the four tags based on nanopore ionic currents. This approach coupled with polymerase attached to the nanopores in an array format should yield a single-molecule electronic Nano-SBS platform.},

Because excitation of the localized surface plasmon resonance of a nanostructured surface or nanoparticle lies at the heart of SERS, the ability to reliably control the surface characteristics has taken SERS from an interesting surface phenomenon to a rapidly developing analytical tool. This article first explains many fundamental features of SERS and then describes the use of nanosphere lithography for the fabrication of highly reproducible and robust SERS substrates. In particular, we review metal film over nanosphere surfaces as excellent candidates for several experiments that were once impossible with more primitive SERS substrates (e.g., metal island films). The article also describes progress in applying SERS to the detection of chemical warfare agents and several biological molecules.},

abstract = {A DNA G-quadruplex (G4) formed at the oncogene c-MYC promoter region functions as a gene silencer. Due to its high stability at physiological K(+) concentrations, its thermodynamics and kinetic properties have not been characterized in physiological solution conditions. In this work, we investigated the unfolding and folding transitions of single c-MYC G4 and several of its truncated or point mutants at 100 mM KCl concentration under mechanical force. We found that the wild type could fold into multiple species, and the major specie has a slow unfolding rate of (1.4 ± 1.0) × 10(-6) s(-1). The force-dependent thermodynamics and kinetic properties of the major specie were obtained by studying a truncated mutant, Myc2345, that contains the G-tracts 2, 3, 4, and 5. As the c-MYC G4 is a prototype of many other intermolecular parallel-stranded G4's, our results provide important insights into the stability of a broad class of promoter G4's which also play a role in transcription regulation and are potential anticancer targets.},

The simplest form of nanopore DNA sequencing utilizes the hypothesis that individual nucleotides of single-stranded DNA passing through a nanopore will uniquely modulate an ionic current flowing through the pore, allowing the record of the current to yield the DNA sequence. We demonstrate that the ionic current through the engineered Mycobacterium smegmatis porin A, MspA, has the ability to distinguish all four DNA nucleotides and resolve single-nucleotides in single-stranded DNA when double-stranded DNA temporarily holds the nucleotides in the pore constriction. Passing DNA with a series of double-stranded sections through MspA provides proof of principle of a simple DNA sequencing method using a nanopore. These findings highlight the importance of MspA in the future of nanopore sequencing.},

abstract = {Isolated, atomically thin conducting membranes of graphite, called graphene, have recently been the subject of intense research with the hope that practical applications in fields ranging from electronics to energy science will emerge. The atomic thinness, stability and electrical sensitivity of graphene motivated us to investigate the potential use of graphene membranes and graphene nanopores to characterize single molecules of DNA in ionic solution. Here we show that when immersed in an ionic solution, a layer of graphene becomes a new electrochemical structure that we call a trans-electrode. The trans-electrode's unique properties are the consequence of the atomic-scale proximity of its two opposing liquid-solid interfaces together with graphene's well known in-plane conductivity. We show that several trans-electrode properties are revealed by ionic conductance measurements on a graphene membrane that separates two aqueous ionic solutions. Although our membranes are only one to two atomic layers thick, we find they are remarkable ionic insulators with a very small stable conductance that depends on the ion species in solution. Electrical measurements on graphene membranes in which a single nanopore has been drilled show that the membrane's effective insulating thickness is less than one nanometre. This small effective thickness makes graphene an ideal substrate for very high resolution, high throughput nanopore-based single-molecule detectors. The sensitivity of graphene's in-plane electronic conductivity to its immediate surface environment and trans-membrane solution potentials will offer new insights into atomic surface processes and sensor development opportunities.},

Tension was applied to a kinesin-microtubule rigor complex using the optical trap, and ATP was released by flash photolysis of caged ATP with a UV laser. Kinesin started to generate force and move stepwise with a step size of 8 nm at average times of 31, 45, and 79 ms after photorelease of 450, 90, and 18 microM ATP, respectively. The kinetics of force generation were consistent with a two-step reaction: ATP binding, with an apparent second-order rate constant of 0.7 microM-1.s-1, followed by force generation at 45 s-1 per kinesin molecule. The transient rate of force generation was close to the rate of the ATPase cycle in solution, suggesting that the rate-limiting step of ATPase cycle is involved with the force generation.},

abstract = {Interactions between helicases and the tracking strand of a DNA substrate are well-characterized; however, the role of the displaced strand is a less understood characteristic of DNA unwinding. Dda helicase exhibited greater processivity when unwinding a DNA fork compared to a ss/ds DNA junction substrate. The lag phase in the unwinding progress curve was reduced for the forked DNA compared to the ss/ds junction. Fewer kinetic steps were required to unwind the fork compared to the ss/ds junction, suggesting that binding to the fork leads to disruption of the duplex. DNA footprinting confirmed that interaction of Dda with a fork leads to two base pairs being disrupted whereas no disruption of base pairing was observed with the ss/ds junction. Neutralization of the phosphodiester backbone resulted in a DNA-footprinting pattern similar to that observed with the ss/ds junction, consistent with disruption of the interaction between Dda and the displaced strand. Several basic residues in the 1A domain which were previously proposed to bind to the incoming duplex DNA were replaced with alanines, resulting in apparent loss of interaction with the duplex. Taken together, these results suggest that Dda interaction with the tracking strand, displaced strand and duplex coordinates DNA unwinding.},

Delivering well-defined amounts of materials into cells is important for various biological studies and therapeutic applications. Here, we show that nanochannel electroporation can deliver precise amounts of a variety of transfection agents into living cells. The device consists of two microchannels connected by a nanochannel. The cell to be transfected is positioned in one microchannel using optical tweezers, and the transfection agent is located in the second microchannel. Delivering a voltage pulse between the microchannels produces an intense electric field over a very small area on the cell membrane, allowing a precise amount of transfection agent to be electrophoretically driven through the nanochannel, the cell membrane and into the cell cytoplasm, without affecting cell viability. Dose control is achieved by adjusting the duration and number of pulses. The nanochannel electroporation device is expected to have high-throughput delivery applications.},

abstract = {We report a new approach, molecular dam, to enhance mass transport for protein enrichment in nanofluidic channels by nanoscale electrodeless dielectrophoresis under physiological buffer conditions. Dielectric nanoconstrictions down to 30 nm embedded in nanofluidic devices serve as field-focusing lenses capable of magnifying the applied field to 10(5)-fold when combined with a micro- to nanofluidic step interface. With this strong field and the associated field gradient at the nanoconstrictions, proteins are enriched by the molecular damming effect faster than the trapping effect, to {\textgreater}10(5)-fold in 20 s, orders of magnitude faster than most reported methods. Our study opens further possibilities of using nanoscale molecular dams in miniaturized sensing platforms for rapid and sensitive protein analysis and biomarker discovery, with potential applications in precipitation studies and protein crystallization and possible extensions to small-molecules enrichment or screening.},

abstract = {Graphene is an ideal thin membrane substrate for creating molecule-scale devices. Here we demonstrate a scalable method for creating extremely small structures in graphene with atomic precision. It consists of inducing defect nucleation centers with energetic ions, followed by edge-selective electron recoil sputtering. As a first application, we create graphene nanopores with radii as small as 3 Å, which corresponds to 10 atoms removed. We observe carbon atom removal from the nanopore edge in situ using an aberration-corrected electron microscope, measure the cross-section for the process, and obtain a mean edge atom displacement energy of 14.1 ± 0.1 eV. This approach does not require focused beams and allows scalable production of single nanopores and arrays of monodisperse nanopores for atomic-scale selectively permeable membranes.},

abstract = {An emerging DNA sequencing technique uses protein or solid-state pores to analyze individual strands as they are driven in single-file order past a nanoscale sensor. However, uncontrolled electrophoresis of DNA through these nanopores is too fast for accurate base reads. Here, we describe forward and reverse ratcheting of DNA templates through the $\alpha$-hemolysin nanopore controlled by phi29 DNA polymerase without the need for active voltage control. DNA strands were ratcheted through the pore at median rates of 2.5-40 nucleotides per second and were examined at one nucleotide spatial precision in real time. Up to 500 molecules were processed at ∼130 molecules per hour through one pore. The probability of a registry error (an insertion or deletion) at individual positions during one pass along the template strand ranged from 10{\%} to 24.5{\%} without optimization. This strategy facilitates multiple reads of individual strands and is transferable to other nanopore devices for implementation of DNA sequence analysis.},

@article{Clemen2005,
abstract = {Myosin-V is a processive two-headed actin-based motor protein involved in many intracellular transport processes. A key question for understanding myosin-V function and the communication between its two heads is its behavior under load. Since in vivo myosin-V colocalizes with other much stronger motors like kinesins, its behavior under superstall forces is especially relevant. We used optical tweezers with a long-range force feedback to study myosin-V motion under controlled external forward and backward loads over its full run length. We find the mean step size remains constant at approximately 36 nm over a wide range of forces from 5 pN forward to 1.5 pN backward load. We also find two force-dependent transitions in the chemomechanical cycle. The slower ADP-release is rate limiting at low loads and depends only weakly on force. The faster rate depends more strongly on force. The stronger force dependence suggests this rate represents the diffusive search of the leading head for its binding site. In contrast to kinesin motors, myosin-V's run length is essentially independent of force between 5 pN of forward to 1.5 pN of backward load. At superstall forces of 5 pN, we observe continuous backward stepping of myosin-V, indicating that a force-driven reversal of the power stroke is possible.},

@article{Raney1995,
abstract = {The T4 bacteriophage Dda helicase is believed to be involved in early events in T4 DNA replication and has been shown to stimulate genetic recombination processes in vitro. Dda unwinds double-stranded DNA with 5' to 3' polarity but its ability to translocate on DNA has not been established. The DNA stimulated ATPase activity of Dda helicase has been used to probe translocation on single-strand DNA (ssDNA). Dda exhibits higher ATPase activity in the presence of poly(dT) than oligo(dT)16, indicating that Dda translocates on ssDNA. Oligonucleotides containing biotin/streptavidin blocks on the 5' or 3' end were used to probe directionality of translocation. The Kact (Km for DNA) for Dda ATPase activity was reduced in the presence of a streptavidin block on the 3' end, whereas a streptavidin block on the 5' end had only a small effect on the steady-state ATPase parameters. These results suggest that Dda translocates unidirectionally in a 5' to 3' manner and upon encountering the block remains bound to the oligonucleotide rather than sliding off the 3' end. The direction of translocation on ssDNA is consistent with the direction in which Dda unwinds duplex DNA and is not dependent on duplex structure.},
