... the movement ascends from the first-beginnings and by successive degrees emerges upon our senses, so that those bodies also are moved which we are able to perceive in the sun's light, yet it does not openly appear by what blows they are made to do so.

\chapter{Single-molecule measurements and thermal motion}
\label{thermal_motion}

Brief historical background.

\section{Thermal motion of ions in an electrolyte}

\section{Noise measurement in the MspA nanopore}

Nanopores with diameters of approximately 1nm have a conductance on the order of 1nS in the open state, and so they conduct a current of about 100pA at 100mV bias.  A current of 100pA is approximately 600 ions per microsecond flowing through the nanopore.

End with a mention that thermal motion of an analyte DNA molecule would be its own source of noise.
