\chapter{Single-molecule measurements and noise}
\label{thermal_motion}

Measurements of single molecules inevitably involve small signals.  Any attempt to measure a small signal will immediately reveal that small signals are often obscured by noise.  The elimination of noise sources is the constant preoccupation of the experimentalist, and it is a necessary precursor to measuring current through a nanopore.

First and foremost, external noise sources must be eliminated to whatever extent possible.  In the experiments reported here, a Faraday cage is used to screen out external electric fields, and a vibration isolation table is used to prevent mechanical disturbances.

Noise in a nanopore experiment can be caused by several different underlying physical mechanisms, which will be described here.  Central to an understanding of noise is the phenomenon of thermal motion of individual molecules, also called Brownian motion.

\section{Current noise in the open MspA nanopore}

A measurement of current in an M2-MspA nanopore in a PC lipid membrane at zero applied bias is shown in Figure \ref{fig:mspa_noise_intro}a.  The current is filtered at \SI{10}{\kHz} in hardware with the 4-pole Bessel filter built into the Axopatch 200B.  A histogram of the current is shown alongside the current-versus-time trace.  The histogram reveals that the current noise is Gaussian distributed, as demonstrated by the gray line Gaussian fit.  In panel (b), the current noise power spectral density is plotted for the same data.

How power spectrum is calculated from data.

The current is \SI{0}{\pA} on average, but there is some spread to the values, shown in the current histogram.  The thin gray line is a Gaussian fit, showing that the current noise is Gaussian distributed.  On the right, the current noise power spectral density is plotted as a function of frequency.  The current noise here is white at frequencies below \SI{1}{\kHz}, where there is a gradual increase due to capacitance, followed by a falloff due to the \SI{10}{\kHz} 4-pole Bessel hardware filter.  For reference, the calculated Johnson noise is shown as a dashed gray line.}

\section{Thermal motion of ions in an electrolyte}

Particles at a temperature $T$ have an associated kinetic energy of $\frac{1}{2} k_B T$ per degree of freedom, where $k_B$ is Boltzmann's constant.  Water molecules and ions in solution therefore have a translational kinetic energy of $\frac{3}{2} k_B T$, and by setting $\frac{1}{2} mv^2 = \frac{3}{2} k_B T$, we find that a molecule or ion with mass $m$ has a root mean square velocity $v=\sqrt{\frac{3 k_B T}{m}}$.  For a potassium ion at \SI{20}{\celsius}, this is \SI{433}{\m/\s}, an incredibly high speed \citep{Hille2001}.  However, in solution, ions and water molecules are constantly colliding with one another and undergoing diffusive random walks.

\section{Contributions to noise in nanopore experiments}

The random thermal motions of ions in solution lead to local variations in electrical potential.  The same thermal motion of electrons in a carbon resistor also leads to fluctuations in potential.  These fluctuations are the physical basis of several contributions to measured noise.  Voltage fluctuations across a resistor cause fluctuating currents, while voltage fluctuations across capacitors cause fluctuating capacitive currents.

\subsection{Thermal fluctuations of charge in resistors}

Voltage fluctuations can be measured across a resistor, and were first quantified in 1928 by John Johnson \citep{Johnson1928} and derived from first principles by Harry Nyquist \citep{Nyquist1928}.  The noise power spectral density, $S_I (f)$, with units of current squared per frequency, is given for a resistor with resistance $R$ by

\begin{equation}
S_I(f) = 4 k_B T / R
\label{eqn:johnson}
\end{equation}

For an arbitrary circuit with complex conductance $Y(f)$, this generalizes via the fluctuation-dissipation theorem to \citep{Kogan1996, Hoogerheide2010, Sakmann1995}

\begin{equation}
S_I(f) = 4 k_B T \operatorname{Re}(Y(f))
\label{eqn:general}
\end{equation}

\noindent
where Re denotes the real part of the complex conductance.  This expression reduces to Equation \ref{eqn:johnson} for the simple case of a resistor.

(c) A circuit model for the nanopore along with simplified measurement electronics.  The feedback resistor $R_f$ in the current amplifier also contributes to measurement noise.}
\label{fig:circuit_equiv}
\end{centering}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Thermal fluctuations of charge across capacitors}

Thermal fluctuations of charge carriers also cause current fluctuations when a capacitance is in series with some resistance.  In the case of a nanopore experiment, a simple model electrical circuit can be drawn as in Figure \ref{fig:circuit_equiv}.  $R_p$ is the resistance of the nanopore, and $R_f$ is the resistance of the amplifier's feedback resistor, \SI{500}{\mega\ohm} for the Axopatch 200B in whole cell mode with $\beta = 1$.  $C_m$ is the capacitance of the membrane, typically a few picofarads, and $R_a$ is the access resistance, which is given by $R_a = \rho/4r$, where $\rho$ is the resistivity of the electrolyte and $r$ is the radius of the nanopore \citep{Hall1975}.  The expression for the complex conductance is

\begin{equation}
Y(f) = i \, 2 \pi \, f \, C_{in} + \left[ 2 R_a + \frac{1}{ 1/R_p + i \, 2 \pi \, f \, C_m } \right]^{-1} + \frac{1}{R_f}
\label{eqn:admittance_model}
\end{equation}

\noindent
where $C_{in}$ is the input capacitance of the amplifier's headstage, about \SI{4}{\pF} for the Axopatch 200B.

\subsection{The case of a non-ideal capacitor}

Another contribution to current noise comes from the fact that no capacitor is completely ideal, and there is some element of dissipation.  This is referred to as dielectric loss, and is described by \citep{•}

\begin{equation}
S_{I,headstage}(f) = 8 \pi k_B T \, f \, C_m \tan \delta
\label{eqn:dielectric}
\end{equation}

\noindent
where for water $\tan \delta \approx 1$ \citep{•}.

\subsection{Conductance fluctuations with an applied bias}

One further source of noise presents itself in nanopore experiments when a voltage bias is applied across the membrane and current begins to flow.  The conductance of the nanopore itself, $1/R_p$, at any given moment depends on the number of ions in the nanopore.  This number is not fixed, and fluctuates due to diffusion.  These conductance fluctuations lead to extra current noise when current is flowing due to an applied bias.  This current noise is proportional to the square of the current, and is shown for M2-MspA in Figure \ref{fig:mspa_noise}.

\subsection{Noise due to the amplifier}

There is also a small amount of input voltage noise at the amplifier's headstage.  This is approximately \SI{3}{\nV/\sqrt{\Hz}} for the Axopatch 200B \citep{Sakmann1995}.  This voltage noise couples to the capacitance of the nanopore system as 

\begin{equation}
S_{I,headstage}(f) = (2 \pi \, f \, C_{in})^2 S_{V,headstage}
\label{eqn:headstage}
\end{equation}

\noindent
where $S_{V,headstage} = ($ \SI{3}{\nV/\sqrt{\Hz}} $)^2$.

\section{Full noise model}

A complete model of the current noise in the experiment is given by a combination of the above factors, and can be written:

\begin{equation}
S_I(f) = 4 k_B T \operatorname{Re} \left( \left[ 2 R_a + \frac{1}{ 1/R_p + i 2 \pi f C_m } \right]^{-1} + \frac{1}{R_f} \right) + 8 \pi k_B T \, f \, C_m \tan \delta + a_{ion} I^2 + (2 \pi \, f \, C_{in})^2 S_{V,headstage}
\label{eqn:full_nosie_model}
\end{equation}

The effects of a filter can be accounted for by modeling the complex transfer function, $h(f)$, in MATLAB.  The filtered noise then obeys $S_{I,filered}(f) = S_I(f) |h(f)|^2$.  The hardware filter used in these experiments is a 4-pole Bessel filter at \SI{10}{\kHz}.

This noise model does a good job approximating the noise measured in experiments.  Figure \ref{fig:noise_model_fit} shows a fit of Equation \ref{eqn:full_nosie_model} to noise measured in M2-MspA.  Three noise plots are shown for applied biases of \SI{0}{\mV}, \SI{100}{\mV}, and \SI{150}{\mV}.  The parameters which were allowed to vary were $R_a$ and $C_m$.  The best fit to all three curves yields values of $R_a = $ \SI{1}{\mega\ohm} and $C_m = $ \SI{0.3}{\pF}.

The best fit of the noise model described here is used to plot the solid black lines, which correspond to $C_m = $ \SI{0.3}{\pF}, and $R_a = $ \SI{1}{\mega\ohm}.  For reference, the Johnson noise is shown as a dashed gray line.  The conductance of the nanopore is \SI{2.27}{\nano\siemens} in \SI{1}{\Molar} KCl, \SI{25}{\m\Molar} phosphate buffer, pH \num{8.00}.}

\section{Further considerations}

Nanopores with diameters of approximately \SI{1}{\nm} have a conductance on the order of \SI{1}{\nano\siemens} in \SI{1}{\Molar} KCl in the open state, and so they conduct a current of about \SI{100}{\pA} at \SI{100}{\mV} bias.  A current of \SI{100}{\pA} is approximately \num{600} ions per microsecond flowing through the nanopore.

End with a mention that thermal motion of an analyte DNA molecule would be its own source of noise.
