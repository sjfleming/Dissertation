He shall see, that nature is the opposite of the soul, answering to it part for part. ... Its beauty is the beauty of his own mind. Its laws are the laws of his own mind. ... So much of nature as he is ignorant of, so much of his own mind does he not yet possess.

chapter 4 work, key findings.

chapter 7 work, key findings.

Promise of nanopores for dna sequencing.  long reads.  improving accuracy due to chemistry and rnns

promise of nanopores for other areas of research beyond nucleic acid.  protein sequencing, protein characterization, enzymology for dna enzymes, possibly for sprnt

integration of nanopores into large arrays

future work toward using pulsing as a strategy to control the motion of dna through nanopore
