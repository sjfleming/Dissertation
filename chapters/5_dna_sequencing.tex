\chapter{The nanopore as a DNA sequencing technology}
\label{dna_sequencing}

Some data obtained from nanopore DNA sequencing experiments has already been presented to provide evidence that thermal motion of ssDNA contributes to the ionic current signal.  This chapter briefly presents recent developments which enabled nanopores to be used as a single-molecule DNA sequencing technology, in order to provide a background for the experiments covered in the rest of this work.

\section{A theory to explain the effect}

M2-MspA introduced the key mutations D90N/D91N/D93N, which changed the amino acids lining the narrowest constriction from negatively-charged aspartic acid residues to neutral asparagine residues.

Amino acids can interact with DNA bases.  By searching through 129 structures of protein-DNA complexes in the Protein Data Bank, Luscombe \textit{et al.} \citep{Luscombe2001} found that asparagine interacts favorably with adenine, while arginine strongly interacts with guanine.
