\chapter{Controlling the movement of a helicase on DNA}
\label{helicase_motion_control}

The general goal and its motivation (talk about homopolymers here).

The broader question about mechanical force in biology, and using mechanical force to get an enzyme to perform its function.

\section{Experiment}

\section{Mechanical force as a sufficient substitute for ATP}

Sliding mode, agreement of current levels.  All sorts of results about sliding distributions, average rates with voltage and temperature.

\section{Attempts at temporal control using voltage pulses}

\subsection{The physical picture}
The idea and a description of the physics.

Limits in terms of membrane charging.

\subsection{Experimetal setup and data}

Experiments and data

\subsection{Analysis and discussion}

discussion.
