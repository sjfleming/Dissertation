\caption[Dda helicase: interactions with ssDNA]{A cutaway view of Dda helicase, showing the ssDNA in its groove.  The major interactions of the protein with the ssDNA are shown by drawing the side-chains involved using a stick representation.  Most of the interactions are between two particular $\alpha$-helices and the ssDNA phosphate backbone.  The two $\alpha$-helices are in different domains of the protein, and move relative to each other when ATP binds.  The other important interaction is the hydrophobic stacking of two phenylalanine rings from the pin (yellow) with the ssDNA bases.}

Most of the interactions of Dda helicase with ssDNA are between polar amino acids and the ssDNA phosphate backbone.  Some hydrophobic stacking interactions also exist between amino acid side chains and the ribose sugars of the ssDNA. \citep{He2012}

The two phenylalanine rings in domain 1B (the ``pin") shown in yellow in Figure \ref{fig:helicase_ssDNA_interactions}, stack with base 6, counting from the 5' end.  This hydrophobic stacking interaction acts as the pawl in a ratchet mechanism, preventing the ssDNA from moving backwards.  Here, backwards refers to a movement of the entire ssDNA strand toward the 3' end, toward the right, where the dsDNA duplex would be located.  Effectively, the pin prevents the unwinding duplex from re-hybridizing.  If the pin is mutated, changing the base-stacking phenylalanine to alanine, and preventing this hydrophobic stacking, then the helicase is unable to unwind dsDNA.  However, this mutation does not prevent the helicase from translocating along ssDNA. \citep{He2012}

Dda helicase moves along ssDNA in the 5' to 3' direction by hydrolyzing ATP.  Dda can even displace streptavidin bound to a 3' biotinylated oligonucleotide \citep{Morris1999}, a result which we confirmed experimentally in Appendix \ref{click_reaction_quad}.
