Figure \ref{fig:helicase_scheme} depicts the experimental scheme for using a helicase enzyme to slow the translocation of DNA through the nanopore, from the cis to the trans side of the lipid membrane.  The helicase, bound to the ssDNA strand at the ssDNA – dsDNA junction, unwinds the dsDNA duplex by stepping forward along the ssDNA, deriving its motion from the hydrolysis of ATP.  When the free 5’ end of the ssDNA strand is pulled into the MspA nanopore, the helicase ends up perched on top of MspA.  The helicase is too large to fit into the vestibule of MspA, and so it is clamped in place by the electrophoretic force which pulls the DNA through the nanopore.  The extent of this clamping, and the thermal motion of the helicase in this clamped state, was explored in Chapter \ref{thermal_motion}, where now the helicase is playing the role previously played by the NeutrAvidin protein.

Of course, unlike the NeutrAvidin protein, the helicase is able to step along the ssDNA.  This helicase is always oriented with its front facing the 3’ end of the ssDNA strand to which it is bound (see the crystal structure in Appendix \ref{helicase}).  It will be shown that the helicase is capable of moving forward (5’ to 3’) and backward (3’ to 5’) along ssDNA; however, the steps associated with hydrolysis of ATP are thought to be exclusively in the forward (5’ to 3’) direction.

\section{Movement of helicase along DNA is revealed by current levels}

In the configuration shown in Figure \ref{fig:helicase_sequencing}a, an ATP-driven step of the helicase will result in the helicase being positioned one base closer to the 3’ end of the DNA, shown in panel (b), and a single base of the duplex will have been unzipped in the process.  As soon as the helicase moves, the electrophoretic force on the DNA causes it to be pulled through the MspA nanopore by one base.  Before the ATP-driven step, the 5 base sequence near the narrow constriction of MspA was \texttt{ATTCG}.  The 5-base sequence near the nanopore’s constriction is referred to as the “5-mer.”  After the ATP-driven step, the 5-mer is \texttt{TTCGC}.  As shown in Figure \ref{fig:helicase_sequencing}c, the measured current depends on the 5-mer, and there is an abrupt step in the current when the helicase takes a step.
