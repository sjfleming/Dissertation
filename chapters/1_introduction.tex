All the physical and chemical laws that are known to play an important part in the life of organisms are of [a] statistical kind; any other kind of lawfulness and orderliness that one might think of is being perpetually disturbed and made inoperative by the unceasing heat motion of the atoms.

Intro.

\section{Motivation and Context}

\begin{enumerate}
\item Single molecule measurements
\item Other techniques for single-molecule measurements
\end{enumerate}

\section{The "Nanopore"}

\begin{enumerate}
\item Nanopores as single-molecule measurement instruments
\item Measuring ionic current through a nanopore
\item Spatial localization of the resistance
\item Electrophoresis and force on molecules near nanopore
\item Physical blockage of nanopore causes change in resistance
\item Brief mention of signal-to-noise, comparison with other techniques
