\chapter{Chemical structure of DNA modifications}
\label{idt_dna}

The DNA used in the experiments described was all purchased from Integrated DNA Technologies Inc. [IDT], unless stated otherwise.  IDT offers many oligo modifications, and several were used throughout the course of this work.  The names of the oligo modifications along with their exact chemical structures are shown in Figure \ref{fig:idt_mods}.
