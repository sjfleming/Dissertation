Nanopores can be used as extremely sensitive instruments to measure properties of individual molecules.  Progress in the nanopore field has been motivated largely by a desire to sequence DNA quickly and accurately.  Recent developments, notably the engineering of the protein \textit{Mycobacterium smegmatis} porin A [MspA] for use in experiments with DNA, have enabled the identification of nucleotide sequence based on measurements of ionic current.

This thesis is focused on attempting to understand and control the motion of a single DNA molecule in an MspA nanopore.  measuring the biophysical properties of DNA in the MspA nanopore, and on
