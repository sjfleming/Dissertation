\textit{``If a Bubble be blown with Water first made tenacious by dissolving a little Soap in it, 'tis a common Observation, that after a while it will appear tinged with a great variety of Colours. ... In the mean while, after all the Colours were emerged at the top, there grew in the center of the Rings a small round black Spot ... which continually dilated it self till it became sometimes more than 1/2 or 3/4 of an Inch in breadth before the Bubble broke. ... I have composed the following Table wherein the thickness ... at which each Colour is most intense and specifick, is expressed in parts of an Inch divided into ten hundred thousand equal parts."}

\textit{[Table shows `Very black' being 3/8 of a part, which is \num{95}\AA]}
